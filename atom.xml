    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a compendium of my thoughts on working as an instructor for a
non-profit coding bootcamp teaching frontend web development (JavaScript and
React). It first establishes the context, then explores the best ways to
maximize teaching impact based on the constraints of the context.</p>

<p>This post has four parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why is this bootcamp different from other ways people learn
coding?</li>
  <li>Two teaching philosophies</li>
  <li>Concrete strategies for practitioners</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous thoughts</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="differences-from-traditional-bootcamps">Differences from traditional bootcamps</h1>
<p>In this section, I set the context for this bootcamp and discuss some
important differences to keep in mind between this bootcamp and other
programming class settings, primarily relating to time and money investment. The
purpose of this background is to start the reader thinking about how this might
affect the students’ mentality.</p>

<h2 id="the-istanbul-bootcamp">The Istanbul Bootcamp</h2>

<p>The bootcamp is approximately five months, with three months of classes and
approximately two months of a final project. The students are mostly
Turkish and Syrian in nationality. The class size is approximately 24. The
male-female ratio is approximately 60-40.</p>

<p>During the application process, the students are asked to do an HTML/CSS
exercise, but otherwise no previous coding experience is required. However, some
students certainly have more existing experience than others, which has the
potential to demoralize students.</p>

<h2 id="from-university">From university</h2>
<p>Compared to university, there are two primary differences in the bootcamp:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Students do not pay for the bootcamp</li>
  <li>Students are not graded in the bootcamp</li>
</ol>

<p>I encourage the reader to consider this question: “why do students in
university make an effort?”</p>

<h2 id="from-paid-bootcamps">From paid bootcamps</h2>
<p>Compared to paid bootcamps, the students are not paying a large sum of money.
The tuition of HackReactor is $18,000. That’s quite an investment.</p>

<h2 id="ramifications">Ramifications</h2>
<p>We’ve established some of the differences between this bootcamp and other
similar venues of teaching coding. Next, let’s consider some 
consequences of these discrepancies.</p>

<p>In this section, I won’t discuss solutions. I will simply posit some of the main
problems.</p>

<h3 id="ease-of-quitting">Ease of quitting</h3>
<p>In this context, the threshold for quitting is much lower than in university or
in paid bootcamps.</p>

<p>Our bootcamp students frequently broach the idea of quitting during stressful
times, likely because the sunk cost is low. In contrast, in university or
paid bootcamps, the threshold is higher, because the student doesn’t want to
lose three years of money and time invested or ten thousands US dollars,
respectively.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-motivation-to-do-assignments">Lack of motivation to do assignments</h3>
<p>Consider this hypothetical: if a university had no grades and no exams, how many
students would do the assignments as compared to a university that had these?</p>

<p>Even in considering this hypothetical, one can see the problem. There is no
external motivator or metric for our bootcamps’ students. Students should only
be removed from the bootcamp for particularly egregious behavior, but it is
certainly not taken lightly, as part of our ethical responsibility is to
encourage them psychologically.</p>

<p>One of my favorite phrases, for all parts of life: “you can’t make anyone do
anything in this world” (barring duress and so on).</p>

<h3 id="propensity-to-complain">Propensity to complain</h3>
<p>In general, students in our bootcamps like to gripe about various parts of the
bootcamp: homework, projects, process, class, etc.. Whether this is due to a
cultural or a venue difference, I can’t say.</p>

<p>However, I do
believe that one reason for this propensity for complaining is the
aforementioned lack of investment, which emboldens the students. While
complaining is not inherently dangerous, a cycle of complaining can cause
students to demotivate each other and consequently increases the risk of
quitting.</p>

<p>Note that there is a nuance between feedback and complaining, and instructors
should still objectively evaluate complaints for genuine feedback.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-differences">Summary of differences</h3>
<p>The summary of these differences is this: for our bootcamps, the student has invested
neither money nor time. The only way to motivate these students is to <strong>foster
an intrinsic interest in participating in the bootcamp</strong>.</p>

<p>The definition of fostering intrinsic interest” will be expounded at length
below.</p>

<p>Outside the scope of this post: the filtering qualities of interviews are also
important in influencing student motivation.</p>

<h1 id="precursors-on-philosophy">Precursors on philosophy</h1>
<p>Before we continue into more concrete strategies, I want
to discuss two of my driving philosophies for teaching.</p>

<h2 id="treating-students-as-relationships">Treating students as relationships</h2>
<p>The first driving philosophy: <strong>the skills that I apply for teaching are
no different from those that I apply for a significant other or close friends</strong>.
That means understanding another individuals needs, desires, life state, past
experiences in the class, etc. What will make this person happy? What is this
person looking for? How can I provide these things?</p>

<p>I truly believe the following statement to be true: the success of this
particular coding bootcamp only slightly depends on how you teach the material,
<strong>it depends almost completely on how loved and motivated you make your students
feel</strong>. In this particular context, when the emotional environment is correct,
the hard work and enthusiasm of the students will follow.</p>

<p>This is not to say that coherent instruction does not make a difference – it
does. But in an art that requires self-research and emotional discipline from
students, a caring instructor with mediocre teaching skills will be far more
impactful than an emotionally-neutered instructor with excellent teaching
skills.</p>

<h2 id="maximizing-impact-for-time">Maximizing impact for time</h2>
<p>The second driving philosophy: find time-cheap but
psychologically-impactful ways to treat students.</p>

<p>Consider this question:
<strong>given that I have N students, how can I make them all feel loved and motivated
while minimizing the average amount of time I spend on an individual student?</strong></p>

<p>The things that I will describe below, for the most part, will not eat up your
time. I wouldn’t do them if they did. But with this “one weird trick”, five
minutes to fifteen minutes of your time can make all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, this graph represents all aspects of my life, not just
teaching. It makes life a bit easier, in my humble opinion, to hunt for these
optimizations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/graph.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="fostering-intrinsic-interest">Fostering intrinsic interest</h1>
<p>Intrinsic interest means that the student cares, in their heart, about doing
well in the course, completing the assignments, and learning the material. A
non-exhaustive list of where intrinsic interest comes from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The student feels cared for by the instructors</li>
  <li>The student feels pride in their work</li>
  <li>The student respects the instructors as people</li>
  <li>The student wants to continue despite hardships in the course</li>
</ul>

<p>In the absence of any other external motivators, our bootcamps have no choice
but to rely on intrinsic interest. This section focuses on
providing <strong>concrete strategies</strong> for intrinsically motivating students. Each
section simultaneously posits a principle and pairs it with a description of a
real, implementable strategy.</p>

<p>This post is not meant to be a solely theoretical
exploration of what motivates students; these actions are intended to be
executed by practitioners.</p>

<h2 id="the-illusion-of-individual-attention">The illusion of individual attention</h2>
<p>I call this the illusion of individual attention, because in a class of 24, it’s
not possible for you to truly give sustained individual attention to every student.
However, you can perpetuate the idea that you are trying your best to get
individual attention to every student.</p>

<p>In a class of this size, students don’t expect individual attention. In fact, I
find that most students are very understanding of the fact that the instructors
are trying to juggle between the students.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the students’ understanding of this is actually something that you
can capitalize on. When you <em>do</em> show a student individual attention, their
awareness of the resource constraints causes them to appreciate your efforts
even more, consequently inspiring them.</p>

<p>The ultimate cost of the actions below are very low, but they mean the world to
the students. Recall our efforts to maximize impact for minimal time.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial one-on-ones:</strong> Have a one-on-one with each student at the beginning of the course.</li>
  <li><strong>Availability for one-on-ones:</strong> Allocate one to two hours each week for 20 minute one-on-ones with students.
Even if they never capitalize on it, they appreciate the fact that it’s
possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Occasional check-ins:</strong> Occasionally message students randomly to ask how they’re doing or what their
thoughts are. It takes less than two minutes of time to message ten students.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="constructing-a-serious-environment">Constructing a serious environment</h2>
<p>The environment and tone that the teaching staff sets is by far one of the most
important things to do. If you seem to be lax about their performance, they will
certainly be lax about their performance.</p>

<p>I’ll cover this section with an anecdote.</p>

<p>The way I came to understand this is a bit amusing, in my opinion. After a few
strict lectures to the class, a number of students approached me concerned
about their performance or actions in the course. (Slightly unrelated note: when
you give strict talks to your whole class about assignments and such, I realized
that every student thinks you’re talking directly about them, even if they’re
doing completely fine).</p>

<p>While my external self had always taken the class very seriously – and my
internal self, of course, to a certain extent – I was truly surprised by how
worried these students were about their performance in the class. My initial
reaction was: “It was just a prank bro. I’m just a kid that likes to
breakdance (not a strict teacher trying to berate you).”</p>

<p>The reason that this surprised me so much was that, previously, I did feel like
I had trouble motivating my students to do their work. After all, recall the
differences that we established in the beginning. There are no grades. There is
no invested money. That’s not to say my students wouldn’t take it seriously, but
why are they taking it <em>this</em> seriously?</p>

<p>But then I realized, that I had unintentionally stumbled upon something that
I’ve always known in my relationships and friendships: <strong>If you are proactive
about taking something seriously, the other person will be much more likely to
take it seriously.</strong> Don’t sit around waiting for the other person to be the one
to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Communicate your investment:</strong> “I take your education very seriously, and I
expect you to take it seriously too.”</li>
  <li><strong>Show with your actions:</strong> Words only mean so much in this world. Show your
students you take it seriously in the quality of your teaching and your
interactions with your students (see all the other sections).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="professionalism-and-personalization">Professionalism and personalization</h2>

<h3 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h3>
<p>The more professional your content is, the more it reinforces students’ belief
in the authority and legitimacy of the classroom.</p>

<p>Suppose the contrasting hypothetical: your slides are poorly written; your
assignment instructions have no consistent formatting; your in-class activities
are full of typos. Inevitably, your students will start learning from other
content on the internet, and they’ll come to the following realization: “Wow,
the teaching materials that our teacher is giving us are shit quality.”</p>

<p>Among my students in particular, I have noticed how captivated they are by the
professional and formal aspects presented by the organization’s onboarding and
branding. To capitalize on that captivation, this professionalism needs to be
continued in the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Professional content:</strong> All slides, assignments, and course material should be formatted professionally and
flawlessly. Minimize typos.</li>
  <li><strong>Agenda slides:</strong> Show an agenda slide at the beginning of each class. It provides a sense of
official-ness, like university.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personalization">Personalization</h3>
<p>Students like the idea that the organization is doing something for them. <em>Just</em> for
them. This doesn’t mean that you have to have written the assignment yourself
from scratch, but it should at least be presented in a manner that suggests that
you’re thinking of the student. Recall the goal: <strong>make the student feel cared
for</strong>.</p>

<p>Compare the following two situations:</p>

<p><strong>Positive impact</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Teacher: We thought about where the class currently is, and the teaching staff
designed this activity for you all based on the your feedback and struggles.
Please do this activity.</p>

  <p>Student: Wow, the teacher put in so much effort for us!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Neutral impact</strong> (but probably negative if chronic)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Teacher: Here’s a link to this site, please do this activity.</p>

  <p>Student: Sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Revamp outside resources:</strong> Avoid chronically linking to other resources for
activities. Either put them in your own document or write your own, giving
proper attribution as needed.  Even the act of putting it in your own document
pushes this edge.</li>
  <li><strong>Emphasize your effort:</strong> Mention to your students how the material was made
by your organization on their behalf. Let them know you made an effort for
them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="projects-that-express-self-identity">Projects that express self-identity</h2>
<p>In the absence of grades, one of the best motivators for effort is to allow
students to express themselves through their work. Humans like expressing
themselves. Humans like to build things, look at it, and say, “This is me. I did
this.” This is a fact, and we can capitalize on this fact in order to
incentivize students.</p>

<p>When ten groups of students do assignments that all look almost exactly the
same, the student does not think, “This is me. I did this.”</p>

<p>My own students have constantly surprised me with how much effort they put into
projects. For example, they come into office hours and talk about the hours
working on something (styling, a special feature they came up, etc.) that was
outside the stated project requirements. Part of this is because I personally
would never do anything beyond the minimal requirements, but part of it is
because, until I was blown away repeatedly by this phenomenon, I had never
realized the power of allowing students to invest their identity in their work.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>

<p>Devise coding projects with open-ended interpretations (in styling or
functionality).</p>

<p>Different project designs can have different degrees of self-identity; I would
argue that some non-zero amount is necessary for every project.</p>

<p>For example, the final project of our course was “the board
project”, which required only the very general concept of boards and items that could be put on
boards. The ultimate result was a wide array of projects with a personal
touch: to-do lists, cookbooks, course project trackers, and the students
ultimately invested much more time than if we had assigned a “to-do list
project.”</p>

<h2 id="social-cohesion">Social cohesion</h2>
<p>When the social aspect of the class is strong, students try harder. Part of it
is that they enjoy the class, but part of it is that most people don’t want to
be known by their friends as the student who doesn’t try.</p>

<p>So the question is this: how do you encourage people to like each other? To be
honest, as instructors, we don’t have much agency here; you can’t make people
form bonds. However, you can try your best to facilitate situations where it can
happen.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project partners:</strong> Select project partners with the intent of forming bonds between students of
similar levels</li>
  <li><strong>Promoting thought:</strong> Ask students who their favorite people to work with are (not for any
particular reason other than for them to ponder this question)</li>
  <li><strong>Allocate time for small socialization</strong>: Encourage socializing and jokes in class, allocate “empty time”</li>
  <li><strong>Use office hours:</strong> Leave time in office hours for students to chat with each other</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expression-of-belief">Expression of belief</h2>
<p>Coding bootcamps can be quite intense for some of the students. There will come
a time when some students don’t believe in themselves or their ability to
understand the content. And when that time comes,
it’s not important whether or not you believed in them, it’s important whether
or not you <strong>communicated that you believed in them</strong>.</p>

<p>I again emphasize the importance of the illusion of individual attention.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete actions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual messaging:</strong> Identifying students that are struggling, and telling them, directly to their
face (via Zoom, this is 2020), that you believe in them. Offer them the option
to meet one-on-one.</li>
  <li><strong>Humbling your journey:</strong> Show that you, too, come from humble beginnings. Whether that means you
went through a bootcamp yourself, or that you struggled a lot when you started
coding, show the students that their struggle is normal. For example, I showed
my students emails from my first two months in coding where I sent emails to
my friend raging about bugs in my code. I had multiple students tell me that
this humanized my journey despite the pedigree.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspirational speeches:</strong> Be liberal with the inspirational speeches in
class. They never stop feeling weird to me, but it matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Emphasize first exposure:</strong> Tell your students that when you show them
something for the first time, they’re not expected to understand it. A phrase
my students are familiar with: “This is just a first exposure.”</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="other-takeaways">Other takeaways</h1>
<p>These are miscellaneous addenda that don’t belong in the categories above, but
these are points I would tell myself if I could travel back in time. In the end,
these happened naturally, but I didn’t codify them into thoughts until the
middle of the course.</p>

<h2 id="teaching-a-way-of-thinking">Teaching a way of thinking</h2>
<p>I encourage you to ask yourself this question: “at the end of the course, who do
I hope my students to be?”</p>

<p>It’s not my place to say what the right or wrong answer is. If you’re a teacher,
you set the goals. But by the way, there is a wrong answer, and that wrong
answer is: “a student that knows JavaScript and React.”</p>

<p>The right answer is that the student:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is no longer scared to learn a new technology or tool</li>
  <li>never compares himself or herself to other people again</li>
  <li>is unfazed by setbacks, even when a small bug costs five hours of time
(instead of thinking, “programming is not for me”)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m certain this is not a novel idea I’m proposing; most successful introductory
computer science courses, such as CS50, operate along the same mentality.</p>

<p>But I’d like to note something interesting here. None of the things above have
to do with specific knowledge of a subject; <strong>they all pertain to how the
students think as people</strong>.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, here are some modes of operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Constantly introduce new things:</strong> Spend the course bombarding students with
new things. Just as they start to feel comfortable with something, you
introduce something (perhaps only slightly) new on top of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo your thought process:</strong> When feasible, walk the student how you thought
about the problem. “You see, I just Googled this thing.” “I worked backwards
from this variable to find the issue.”</li>
  <li><strong>Comfort your students:</strong> When your students finally fix a bug that took them
forever, comfort them psychologically. Tell them it’s normal. Emphasize your
belief in them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trust-the-process">Trust the process</h2>
<p>The students will learn the material eventually – trust the process. I’ll admit
that even I wasn’t sure whether my students were learning anything at some
point. There were times in the course when almost all of the students seemed
completely lost in all of the in-class activities (to be fair, I was also
pushing the pace very quickly).</p>

<p>Luckily, I had my trusty teaching partner Ammar, who informed me that
these struggles were normal. In the same way that I tell my students, “Hey, this
is normal,” Ammar’s evaluation sealed away any concerns I had. In the end, I
trust Ammar’s judgment completely, given that he’d experienced two bootcamps
before me.</p>

<p>I’ll also say this: in-class activities are a very short amount of time to exercise
real exploration beyond basics. The core of the learning will come from the
multi-week projects that students do. That’s the real shit, pardon my French.
And if the students are invested in completing projects, the learning will
follow.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>At this point, I’d like to highlight a critical observation: <strong>none of these
actions take much time</strong>. They are simply small flourishes to the interactions
with students.</p>

<p>But if you’ve ever played any skill-based game, then you’ll be familiar with
this concept: the people who are the best at anything in life are those that
push all the smallest advantages. The best chess players leave no tradeoff
unpunished. The best football players leave no misstep unexploited. Capitalizing
on small edges differentiates one who is the best at something and one who is
average.</p>

<p>Finally, achieving anything in our lives is a function of our goals, and sometimes it’s
good to recall our broader goals. In whatever context you teach in, I encourage
you to refresh your goals. For Re:Coded, they would be this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To teach students the programmer mindset</li>
  <li>To empower students to obtain and excel at a development job</li>
</ul>

<p>And to achieve these goals, we should not simply be settling at teaching our
students React and JavaScript. The question is not where can we take the
students, but <em>how far</em> can we take them?</p>

<p>And for that reason, I urge you to
never be complacent with your students.</p>

<p>One hour of your time a week could be the difference between some of your
student hating or loving the course.</p>

<p>Two hours of your time a week could be the difference between your student
landing a frontend job or not.</p>

<p>Three hours of your time a week could be the difference between your student
landing a job on a weak currency or a strong one.</p>

<p>Calculate the margins, and remember the graph.</p>

    <updated>2020-07-01T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2020/07/01/istanbul-to-sile</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The intention of this post is to document how to travel from Istanbul to Şile by
bus. At the time of writing, there do not appear to be any English resources for
this route. The official IETT app and Google Maps both document this incorrectly.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Şile is a popular place for the residents of Istanbul to escape for a day trip.
Technically, Şile is part of Istanbul, although it’s quite remote. The bus ride
is about two hours away; by car, it is about 45 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="bus-line">Bus Line</h2>
<p>Taking any bus that is prefixed with <strong>139</strong> is okay, all of them stop at Şile
first but their continuing routes after Şile may differ.</p>

<p>The
<a href="https://www.iett.istanbul/en/main/hatlar/139/%C3%9CSK%C3%9CDAR%20-%20%C5%9E%C4%B0LE-%C4%B0ETT-Otob%C3%BCs-Sefer-Saatleri-ve-Duraklar%C4%B1">IETT</a>
site gives a description of the stops; however, as explained below, the bus stop
location is incorrect on the site. Also note that this link only shows the 139
bus, but the 139A, 139T, etc. also run, meaning that there is approximately one
bus to Şile every hour.</p>

<p>The bus has various stops in the Şile area, though the bus terminal is a safe
bet for a place to get off.</p>

<h2 id="bus-stop-location">Bus Stop Location</h2>
<p><strong>Do not wait at the Üsküdar Marmaray bus station.</strong> The correct location for
this intercity bus is the Şemsipaşa stop (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3YyADTwU8gENbKk98">Google Maps
link</a>), which is about a block west.
There, you will see a paper with times for the bus to Şile.</p>

<p>A ticket is required for this bus. The place to purchase the tickets is about a
two minute walk from the bus stop (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R4AqwriFRpaxxnDp8">Google Maps
link</a>). At the time of writing (July
2020), a one way ticket was 14.50 lira. If you don’t speak Turkish, you probably
can’t get on the bus without a ticket, although I’ve been told it’s possible to
sit on the floor if the bus is full.</p>

<p>If you try to buy too close to the departure time, it’s possible that the bus
may be full.</p>

<p>It may be possible to buy online, but the author of this article doesn’t know
how.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes how to use React (Typescript) and MathJax.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>There are a few performance optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo">React.memo</a> makes it so
that even if the parent rerenders but the Latex does not change, the component
does not rerender
(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54015086/how-to-prevent-child-component-from-re-rendering-when-using-react-hooks-and-memo">reference</a>).</li>
  <li>The MathJax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typeset()</code> is only called when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rawLatex</code> changes. Technically,
this is unnecessary, as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">React.memo</code> should mean that it only rerenders
when the prop changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can either load MathJax in the head or load it dynamically in other ways.
With Next.js, I was running into issues with using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Head&gt;</code> tag; see <a href="./2020-06-04-react-dynamic-script-hook">how to
dynamically load scripts in React</a>.</p>

<div class="language-typescript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/**

<p>This is a modification on the code presented in <a href="https://cleverbeagle.com/blog/articles/tutorial-how-to-load-third-party-scripts-dynamically-in-javascript">this
article</a>.
The script adds a script tag to the page and optionally calls a callback. It
will not add the script again if it is already loaded. If a callback was
provided, then it removes the script from the page when the component unmounts
(so that the callback can be called again).</p>

<p>This post talks about the concept of “fiilimsi”, which are nouns, adjectives, or
adverbs derived from verbs. In English, for example, these include gerunds
(“<em>Running</em> is fun”) or participle adjectives (“The dog <em>that I saw</em>”).</p>

<p>This post is not intended to be a comprehensive resource of all fiilimsi.
There are three categories of fiilimsi:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>isim-fiil</strong>: verbal noun</li>
  <li><strong>sıfat-fiil</strong>: verbal adjective</li>
  <li><strong>zarf-fiil</strong>: verbal adverb</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a noticeable lack of English language resources on the internet about
certain Turkish language topics. There’s a few articles about verbal derivations
but only with minimal details. I hope this post fills that niche.</p>

<p>Almost all of this material was derived from a lesson on the <a href="https://discord.me/turkceogrenelim">Türkçe Öğrenelim
Discord</a>. Feel free to join the community
and support them on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/letslearnturkish">Patreon</a>.</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This post is not intended for complete beginners of Turkish grammar. Fiilimsi
builds on many of the foundations of Turkish grammar. This post assumes
prerequisite familiarity in the following topics,
and as such will not be explaining any of the following in example
sentences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Possessive</li>
  <li>Buffer letters, consonant mutation, vowel harmony</li>
  <li>Infinitive form</li>
  <li>Subjects and objects in Turkish</li>
</ul>

<p>There are sentence examples and grammar derivations that utilize the following,
though it’s possible to grasp the basic idea without a strong understanding of
these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple present tense, past tense</li>
  <li>Dative, locative, accusative cases</li>
  <li>Future tense</li>
  <li>Reported past tense</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="isim-fiil-verbal-nouns">Isim-fiil: Verbal nouns</h1>

<h2 id="-makmek-infinitive-as-a-subject">-mak/mek: Infinitive as a subject</h2>

<p>Infinitives are the “dictionary form” of a verb ending with <strong>-mak/mek</strong>, e.g.,
bakmak (to look).</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The verbal noun infinitive form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used as subject</li>
  <li>cannot be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension">declined</a> – that is, no
suffixes are added to it</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqIEiUv1bVQ">a line from this song</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Eğlenmek</strong> güzel şey.<br />
<strong>To have fun</strong> is a beautiful thing / <strong>having fun</strong> is a beautiful thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that there are many other uses of the infinitive, but here
we’re talking only about its usage as a noun derived from a verb.</p>

<h2 id="-mame-gerund-form">-ma/me: Gerund form</h2>

<p>The gerund form is constructed by adding <strong>-ma/-me</strong> to the verb root
(alternatively, one can think of simply removing the <strong>k</strong> from the infinitive).</p>

<ul>
  <li>yap<strong>ma</strong> (doing)</li>
  <li>bak<strong>ma</strong> (looking)</li>
  <li>sor<strong>ma</strong> (sormak)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usage-1">Usage</h3>
<p>The gerund form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used as object</li>
  <li>can be declined</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>Kitap <strong>okuma</strong>yı seviyorum.<br />
I love reading books.</p>

  <p>Dans <strong>etme</strong>ye başladım.<br />
I started dancing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: The <em>-ma/-me</em> suffix is also used for the negative conjugation, but do
not confuse it with the gerund construction. They can actually stack, for
example <strong>anla-ma-ma</strong> is the noun “not understanding” (<strong>anlamak</strong> – to
understand).</p>

<h3 id="declension-exception-ablative">Declension exception: ablative</h3>
<p>There is one exception where we use the infinitive instead; for the ablative
form (<strong>-dan/den</strong>), we still use the infinitive form. This also violates the
“no declension infinitive” rule. In the example below, eğlenmekten is the
object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Eğlenmekten</strong> keyif alırım.<br />
I enjoy having fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likely this is because the gerund form causes ambiguity with
<strong>-meden/-madan</strong> (eğlenmeden), which is also a verbal adverb suffix.</p>

<h3 id="declension-exception-locative">Declension exception: locative</h3>

<p>The locative can also be used interchangeably in some contexts. In the example
below, both are valid uses of the verbal noun as an object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>Böyle yap<strong>mada</strong> sorun yok.<br />
Böyle yap<strong>makta</strong> sorun yok.<br />
There is no problem in doing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you cannot use the genitive suffixes with the infinitive, so for the
example sentence below, there is only one valid construction (yap-ma-n-da, with
the n coming from the second-person genitive).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>Böyle yap<strong>manda</strong> sorun yok.<br />
There is no problem in your doing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize, you cannot use the accusative, dative, or genitive suffixes with
the infinitive, but you can use the ablative and locative.</p>

<h2 id="native-speaking-gerund-and-infinitive">Native speaking: gerund and infinitive</h2>
<p>There’s a tricky exception that’s technically not correct but will be seen in
daily speech. People add (gerund + possessed) suffixes as a way of
creating a verbal noun in lieu of <strong>both the gerund and infinitive forms above</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject example</strong></p>

  <p>Denizde <strong>yüzmek</strong> eğlenceli. (gramatically correct)<br />
Denizde <strong>yüzmesi</strong> eğlenceli. (seen in daily speech)<br />
<strong>Swimming</strong> in the sea is fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have <strong>yüz-me-si</strong>, which adds the gerund and possessed
suffixes, respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Object example</strong></p>

  <p>Denizde <strong>yüzmeyi</strong> seviyorum.<br />
Denizde <strong>yüzmesini</strong> seviyorum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have <strong>yüz-me-si-n-i</strong>, which adds the gerund, possessed,
-n- possessed buffer, and accusative suffixes, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="-ısişuşüş-the-way-of">-ıs/iş/uş/üş: “the way of”</h2>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: “the way of” is not always the exact meaning of this suffix; it
can vary phrase by phrase. However, it can give a general idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>yap<strong>ış</strong> (the way of doing)</li>
  <li>bak<strong>ış</strong> (the way of looking)</li>
  <li>sor<strong>uş</strong> (the way of asking)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two words derived in this manner that are very common on signs: giriş
and cıkış (entrance and exit).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>Bana <strong>bakışını</strong> sevmiyorum. <br />
I don’t like the way you looked at me.</p>

  <p>Onun <strong>çıkışını</strong> gördün mü? <br />
Did you see how he left? / Did you see the way he left?</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="sıfat-fiil-verbal-adjectives">Sıfat-fiil: Verbal adjectives</h1>

<h2 id="-yan-en-subject-participles">-(y)an/-en: Subject participles</h2>
<p>In English, you’ll see this grammar concept associated with the terms relative
clause and participle.</p>

<p>We use these to form a verbal adjective that describes a noun.
It is called the subject participle because the described noun is the subject
performing the action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>evime gel<strong>en</strong> misafir<br />
the guest <strong>who comes / is coming / came</strong> to my house</p>

  <p>uyu<strong>yan</strong> adam <br />
the man <strong>who sleeps / is sleeping / slept</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>

<p>Negation works as one might expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>uyu<strong>mayan</strong> adam<br />
the man <strong>who is not sleeping</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In practice, the -y- buffer will always be there since <strong>-ma/me</strong> end
with a vowel.</p>

<h3 id="tense">Tense</h3>
<p>The tense is implied by context. It can take the present continuous, simple
past, and simple present (aka wide present) tenses.</p>

<h2 id="-dik-and-possessor-suffix-object-participles">-dIk and possessor suffix: Object participles</h2>

<p>Recall that <strong>-dIk notation</strong> indicates it could be <strong>-dık -dik -duk -dük</strong>. The
d also mutates to t when appropriate (consonant mutation).</p>

<p>This adjective is called the object participle, because the noun described by
the verbal adjective is the object of the verb. Because of this, we also need to
specify who is performing the action of the verb; this is done by the possessor
ending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>oku<strong>duğum</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that I read / am reading / read (the past)</strong></p>

  <p>oku<strong>duğun</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that you read (…same tenses)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In practice, the <strong>k</strong> in <strong>-dIk</strong> almost always mutates to a <strong>ğ</strong> since all
of the possessor endings start with a vowel. The only exception is when the
plural is added to onlar, as below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (with onlar)</strong></p>

  <p>onların <strong>okuduğu</strong> kitap<br />
onların <strong>okudukları</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that they read / am reading / read (past)</strong></p>

  <p>oku<strong>duğun</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that you read (…same tenses)</strong></p>
  <h3 id="negation-1">Negation</h3>
  <p>Negation again works as one would expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>bak<strong>madığım</strong> adam<br />
the man <strong>who I am not looking at</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tense-1">Tense</h3>
<p>The tense is implied by context. It can take the present continuous, simple
past, and simple present (aka wide present) tenses.</p>

<h3 id="usage-with-sonra">Usage with sonra</h3>

<p>You will also see this suffix used with the word sonra (“after”), but without the
possessed ending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>O kahvaltı yap<strong>tıktan sonra</strong> bir sigara içer.<br />
After eating breakfast, he smokes a cigarette.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, it is not symmetrically used with önce, which uses the <strong>-mAdAn</strong>
suffix with verbs with our previously described gerund form.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Uyu<strong>madan önce</strong> kitap okurum.<br />
Before sleeping, I read books.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="future-and-reported-past-participles">Future and reported past participles</h2>
<p>Building upon the two forms we learned above, we can create both object and
subject participles using the suffixes of both the future and reported past tenses. These tenses
won’t be covered here, so this section can be skipped if the reader is not
familiar with them.</p>

<p>Understanding of these derivations follow easily with an understanding of the
<strong>-acak/ecek</strong> future suffixes and the <strong>-mış/miş/muş/müş</strong> reported past
suffixes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (future tense)</strong></p>

  <p>konuşacak adam<br />
the man who will speak</p>

  <p>konuşacağı adam<br />
the man he/she will talk to</p>

  <p>adam konuşacak<br />
the man will talk (normal future tense)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (reported past tense)</strong></p>

  <p>kitap <strong>okumuş</strong> çocuk<br />
the child <strong>who (apparently) read</strong> books</p>

  <p><strong>boşanmış</strong> kadın<br />
the woman <strong>who (apparently) was divorced</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-verbal-adjectives">Other verbal adjectives</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of other verbal adjectives, often with different meaning.
There’s a <a href="https://www.dilbilgisi.net/fiilimsi-konu-anlatimi/">Turkish page</a>
containing some of them here, but they’re less important and often vary in
meaning phrase-by-phrase.</p>

<h1 id="zarf-fiil-verbal-adverbs">Zarf-fiil: Verbal adverbs</h1>
<p>This is not intended to comprehensively cover all zarf-fiil, but it covers a
few of the most common ones.</p>

<h2 id="-eliali-since">-eli/ali: Since</h2>
<p>This suffix means “since” in the sense of time passing (not “since” as in the
word “because”, which can also be used in English). It can only be used events
happening since a specific time duration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Okuldan <strong>geleli</strong> beş saat oldu.<br />
It has been five hours <strong>since I came</strong> from the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to express the concept of “since” relative to an event, then the
verb is repeated in the past tense.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Türkiye’ye <strong>geldim geleli</strong> birçok kişiyle tanıştım.<br />
I’ve met many people <strong>since I came</strong> to Turkey.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="subject-of-the-since-clause">Subject of the since-clause</h3>
<p>The subject is optional, but it can be used to clarify the subject of the since-clause when it cannot be derived from context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (with pronoun)</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Sen</strong> okuldan gel<strong>eli</strong> beş saat oldu.<br />
It has been five hours since <strong>you</strong> came from the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-madanmeden-before-with-önce--without">-madan/meden: before (with önce) / without</h2>

<h3 id="meaning-without">Meaning “without”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Maske <strong>takmadan</strong> dışarı çıkmak yasaktır.<br />
It is forbidden to go out <strong>without wearing</strong> a mask.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="meaning-before">Meaning “before”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Ben polisi aramadan buradan ayrıl.<br />
Leave this place before I call the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="with-önce">With önce</h4>
<p>In the section on -dIk, it was explained that “(verb + dIktAn) sonra” could be used to say something that happened after an action. The -madan/meden suffix serves is often seen with <em>önce</em>. With or without önce is essentially the same (to my understanding).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Çalışmaya başla<strong>madan önce</strong> bir kahve içerim.<br />
Before studying, I drink a coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="-madan-meden-modifying-a-negative-verb">-madan/-meden modifying a negative verb</h4>
<p>There is a second construction using -madan/-meden. In this one, if the modified verb is negative, then the adverb happens first in the sequence of events. This is a bit confusing to explain but easily clarified with equivalent examples. Note the negative suffix in the verbs below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Kitap <strong>okumadan</strong> yat<strong>ma</strong>dı.<br />
Kitap okudu ve yattı. (equivalent)<br />
He read a book before he slept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A direct English translation can be a bit weird due to the negatives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question example</strong></p>

  <p>Siz ne <strong>yapmadan</strong> okula gitmiyorsunuz?<br />
What do you <strong>do before</strong> going to school?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example could literally be translated as, “you don’t go to school before
doing what?”</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=V_bC-hn7cC8">This video</a> (in Turkish, albeit slow
Turkish) is a good explanation of this negative construction. Credit goes to
this video for the examples above.</p>

<h2 id="-ar--maz---er--mez-as-soon-as">-ar -maz / -er -mez: as soon as</h2>
<p>Note that the title isn’t precisely correct, the set of suffixes is the same as
those used in the simple present tense, which has a ruleset not within the scope
of this article. One can think of this construction as simply the positive and
negative simple present tense third person forms in succession.</p>

<p>Like -eli/ali, the subject is implied by context, but can optionally be
clarified by a pronoun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>(Biz) <strong>Dışarıya çıkar çıkmaz</strong> yağmur başladı.<br />
<strong>As soon as we went out,</strong> it started to rain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example constructions</strong></p>

  <p>yapar yapmaz<br />
gelir gelmez<br />
görür görmez</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-yarakerek-by">-(y)arak/erek: “by”</h2>
<p>This adverb indicates that something was achieved in a certain manner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Türkçe <strong>öğrenerek</strong> ne yapmayı planlıyorsun?<br />
What do you plan to do <strong>by learning</strong> Turkish?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good way to remember this is the word <strong>bilerek</strong>, which means “on purpose.”
But with the literal translation of the suffix, it would mean “by knowing.”</p>

<h2 id="negation-2">Negation</h2>
<p>Simply add -ma/-me with a y buffer. For example, <strong>istemeyerek</strong>
(unintentionally, reluctantly, “by not wanting”).</p>

<h2 id="-ıpipupüp-two-actions-in-succession">-ıp/ip/up/üp: two actions in succession</h2>
<p>Again, notice that the subject is implied in the example sentence below. The
suffixed verb is the one that occurs first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Konuyu <strong>anlatıp pratik</strong> yapacağız.<br />
We will explain the subject and then do practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, there is only one usage of -ip in a sentence.</p>

<h3 id="-ip-durmak-idiom">-ip durmak: idiom</h3>
<p><strong>-ip durmak</strong> means to keep doing something all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

  <p>Öksürüp duruyor.<br />
He’s constantly coughing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="difference-from-sonradan">Difference from sonradan</h3>
<p>Sonradan (“afterwards”) can ostensibly express the same set of sentences, but
the connotation is slightly different. With -ip, the implication is that one
thing happened very quickly after another, while with sonradan, the time gap
could be wider.</p>

<h2 id="further-reference">Further reference</h2>
<p>The end of Unit 10 in <em>The Delights of Learning Turkish</em> is a decent English
language resource for these verbal adverbs.</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2020/02/21/sim-card/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-21T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2020/02/21/sim-card</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Getting a SIM card in Turkey for short to medium term stays in Turkey is
straightforward. In this article, I describe my experience with prices in
<em>February 2020</em> using Turkcell.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I bought my SIM card in Fatih. I’m actually not sure if what I got was a good
deal. Turkcell offers all types of short-term deals for tourists as well. I
visited three stores in Fatih and they all gave me approximately the same rate
(some trying to squeeze +/- 10 lira) without the option for any smaller plans.</p>

<p>These rates are for foreigners. You’ll see advertisements for cellphone data at
amazing prices, but these require a Turkish bank account.</p>

<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>My plan was <strong>20 GB data for 120 lira</strong> (around 20 USD at the time of writing). However,
it should be noted that the 20 GB is <strong>for one month only</strong>.</p>

<p>Although the SIM card lasts for multiple months, you do need to top up in future
months. The top-up is at a rate rate that I don’t remember, but it’s much
cheaper than the initial upfront cost.</p>

<p>I didn’t really keep track of the SMS and call time in the plan, though that’s
included. It’s 2020, use WhatsApp :)</p>

<h3 id="long-term-stays">Long-term stays</h3>
<p>It should be noted that the SIM card situation for long-term stays (more than
120 days) gets much more expensive. You have to pay a foreigner registration fee
that’s more than 200 USD. I won’t go much into it here, but you can read about
it <a href="https://toomanyadapters.com/buying-sim-card-turkey/">on this page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="purchasing">Purchasing</h2>
<p>Bring your passport. It took about ten to fifteen minutes for the guy to finish
registering everything.</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2020/02/21/sahibinden/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-21T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2020/02/21/sahibinden</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sahibinden</strong> (literally, “owners”) is the Craigslist equivalent of Turkey.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>In order to respond to listings (at least housing listings, in my experience),
you do need access to a Turkish cellphone number. The site will ask you to enter
a verification code that is texted to the Turkish number before you can respond.</p>

<h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
<p>Sahibinden’s housing search is top-notch. In addition to the filters that one
would expect such as flat type and price, it also allows filtering by
furnished/unfurnished, renting from owner/broker, building age.</p>

<p><img src="/images/travel/sahibinden/example.png" alt="Example map search" /></p>

<p>On a separate topic, finding housing in Istanbul has a number of options. I’d
recommend reading <a href="https://yabangee.com/finding-a-flat-in-istanbul-a-basic-guide-to-accommodation/">this article</a>, particularly on the difference between renting
from a broker and an owner.</p>

<p>Note: I do dispute one part of this article. They say that renting through an
owner usually has higher quality furnishing. At least in Sisli, my experience
was the opposite: broker flats tended to be newer and have better
furnishing. Most importantly, there were way more broker listings than owner
listings, which meant that the options were “better” for my specific needs based
purely on a higher volume of selection.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-shady-housing-deals">Avoiding shady housing deals</h3>
<p>Like Craigslist, Sahibinden actually includes a warning about housing scams,
though it’s in Turkish. This notification is mostly common sense: don’t wire
money to anyone you haven’t actually met.</p>

<p>I also found that some ads seemed to reuse pictures from other ads (e.g., two
flats in different locations with the exact same pictures and different owners).
Usually, one of them (I believe) is a scam. Longer-term accounts have a
small award image for how long they’ve been on Sahibinden (e.g., 11 years); the
shady ones had no such image. I’m not saying all accounts without the award are
scams, but if you run into two ads with the same pictures, the legitimate one is
probably the certified one.</p>

<p>My friend that lives in Istanbul also told me a few other things to watch out
for when using Sahibinden for housing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Renting daily flats through Sahibinden is difficult (even short- to
medium- term can be a bit of a hassle, as many owners want stable tenants.
However, when renting from a broker, they do like short-term tenants because
they usually charge the full broker fee of one month’s rent).</li>
  <li>Posters will often post really nice looking pictures but the apartment
actually looks a lot worse in person.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The best ATM in Istanbul, Turkey is a coveted title. There’s a lot of banks that
accept international cards, but some of them will try to extract more money from
you via service fee or dynamic currency conversion (DCC).</p>

<p>The best ATM is <strong>HSBC</strong> (only 1000 lira at a time, mixed denominations).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-best-atm-hsbc">The Best ATM: HSBC</h2>
<p>At the moment, HSBC has no extra fees and serves mostly 100 TL bills with some
50 and 20 TL.</p>

<p>In February 2020, QNB used to allow large transactions, no fees, and serving
only 100 TL bills, but this is no longer the case as of June 2020.</p>

<p>Depending on the ATM, they may try to apply DCC, so when the DCC menu comes
up, make sure to click <strong>Istemiyorum</strong> (it was on the left side), which means:
“I do not want.” Make sure you say no to DCC. DCC is very bad (Google it).</p>

<p>See the table below for a relative comparison.</p>

<h2 id="atm-comparisons">ATM Comparisons</h2>
<p>Credit for this table goes to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Turkey/comments/cute4k/a_guide_to_turkish_atms_if_you_are_using_a_card/">some anonymous user on
Reddit</a>, who I’m actually,
very truly grateful for taking the time to write and do this exploration. As of
February 2020, I can verify that at least some of these were true, as I tried
about five ATMs in central Sisli.</p>

<h2 id="fees-on-the-card-side">Fees on the card side</h2>
<p>This is not really an advertisement, since I don’t really make money
from this blog.</p>

<p>In addition to the fees charged by the owning bank of the ATM, the owning bank
of the card might also have foreign transaction fees. I use Charles Schwab (for
my god-bless USA of bank account), which has no fees. It also waives ATM fees,
but I’ve actually never been sure if that works for international bank fees such as
the ones above.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason this inspires you to sign up for Schwab, I have <a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/refer-prospect.html?refrid=REFERY23JXD3D">this

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2018/06/24/is-couchsurfing-safe-and-other-common-questions/"/>
    <updated>2018-06-24T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2018/06/24/is-couchsurfing-safe-and-other-common-questions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://couchsurfing.com">Couchsurfing</a> is a site that connects travelers to local hosts in a city.
As long as both the traveler and host agree, the traveler stays with the host free of charge. 
Although the traveler stays for free, experienced couchsurfers don’t view the site as a way to find
free lodging but instead as an opportunity to spend time with a local.</p>

<p>I usually try to Couchsurf when I travel, though it’s not always possible depending on the popularity of the destination. At the time of writing, I’ve stayed with about ten hosts through my travels.</p>

<p>This post is targeted towards people who are curious about using Couchsurfing as a guest but unsure
what to expect from the experience.</p>

<!-- more -->

<!-- I have a [travel-related YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtD-FIua473Cf6Ylh3PeoEmoq3c6BJH0S).

<h2 id="is-couchsurfing-safe">Is Couchsurfing safe?</h2>
<p>The most common question is: is Couchsurfing safe?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, but use caution. You’re signing up to stay in a stranger’s home, so you
definitely want to research your host beforehand. A well-reviewed host is a pretty safe bet.</p>

<p>Couchsurfing works on a reference system; both hosts and guests provide references after the
exchange. Personally, I only look for hosts that have a decent number of references (five or more).
By definition, this also increases the chances that they’re willing to accept guests.</p>

<p>However, navigating references can be tricky. Even if a guest had a slightly bad experience,
negative references are rare; guests don’t want to receive a negative reference in return.
This has two implications.</p>

<p>First, even a single negative
reference, for both a host or a guest, is considered a major red flag – something very egregious
must have happened. Second, finding out whether a
host is problematic requires carefully reading reviews. Since guests may tiptoe around directly
negative feedback, it’s important to analyze for any hints of negativity dispersed among
compliments (e.g., host was too controlling, didn’t show up, etc.).</p>

<p>As an unfortunate reality of the world, Couchsurfing can be more difficult for females.  Many
articles describe unwanted solicitation from hosts. My recommendation is to prefer female
couchsurfing hosts, although those are harder to find. Otherwise, carefully read other females’
reviews for a particular host.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-do-with-your-hosts">What do you do with your hosts?</h2>
<p>There’s no definitive answer - it completely depends on your host.</p>

<p>Different hosts have different personalities, schedules, budgets, and so on. All of them will talk
to you, but not all will actually hang out. Your host is <em>not</em> obligated to be your tour guide.</p>

<p>A non-exhaustive spectrum of hosts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosts that don’t hang out outside of home, often because they host couchsurfers non-stop and
can’t afford time-wise to show every guest around the city</li>
  <li>Hosts that work during the day and want to get dinner in the evening</li>
  <li>Hosts that will spend a whole day to take you somewhere or show you around</li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate this concretely, here are things I’ve done in the past with my hosts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiked at a national park and got stuck (Taiwan)</li>
  <li>Walked around for an hour and had a beer (Copenhagen)</li>
  <li>Went to a Noel Gallagher concert (Copenhagen)</li>
  <li>Talked for a few hours, staying only one night (Petah Tiqva)</li>
  <li>Cooked dinner (Venice)</li>
  <li>Ate ramen at home (Seoul)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-accommodations">What are the accommodations?</h2>
<p>Similarly, your accommodations vary depending on host.</p>

<p>Hosts will be very annoyed if you treat Couchsurfing like a hostel or hotel. Be considerate, clean
up after yourself, and so on: they’re not obligated to provide any services. After all, they’re
letting you crash in their home <em>for free.</em> In this vein, most hosts do not give their guests a key,
rightfully not wanting a stranger to freely have access to their home.</p>

<p>A few examples of my past accommodations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A couch, many times</li>
  <li>Shared a bed with my host, twice (not in any sexual fashion)</li>
  <li>A private room with a bed in a penthouse apartment (super rare, obviously!)</li>
  <li>A guy who had 10+ couchsurfing guests in his apartment at any time with people sleeping
everywhere</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-find-a-host-to-stay-with">What can I do to find a host to stay with?</h2>
<p>Couchsurfing is a two-way street. The host needs to want you to stay with them, and you need to want
stay with the host. From their perspective, they’re inviting a stranger into their home, so you want
to present yourself as a respectful and considerate guest.</p>

<p>Couchsurfing hosts, especially in popular destinations, are often spammed with grammar-mangled,
copy-pasted requests. Your goal is to stand out from this crowd.</p>

<h3 id="write-a-personalized-well-constructed-message">Write a personalized, well-constructed message</h3>
<p>Writing a personalized message request will maximize your chances of finding a host. Hosts want to
know that you’re asking to stay with <em>them</em>, not just mass-spamming for a free stay.  In fact, many
hosts’ profiles will ask guests to include some “passphrase” statement to ensure that the requester
has actually read the profile.</p>

<p>When I write a request, I always start strong with a few sentences personalized to the host’s
profile, then I write a
short two or three sentence copy-paste about my visit in the city. If the host wants to find out
more about me, the rest is on my Couchsurfing profile.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a message I sent that introduces me briefly, indicates that I read their
profile, and states that I’m flexible about hanging out. The first paragraph is personalized (the
host’s profile mentions something about Latin dances); the second one is copy-pasted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey (host name),</p>

  <p>My name is Louis, I’m also in IT (I work in the USA as a programmer). I’m going to be in
Istanbul for a few days before I travel to Erbil to teach breakdancing, would you be willing to host
me for two nights? Unfortunately, I don’t know any Latin dances :(</p>

  <p>I’ve couchsurfed many times in the past, and I’m a very respectful and clean guest. I’m also down to
hang out or not depending on your schedule – these are weekday dates so I expect you might be
working. My schedule is very open to spend time together, except that I may be meeting up with other
dancers one of the nights.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="have-a-well-fleshed-out-profile">Have a well-fleshed out profile</h3>
<p>If you are trying to find a host for the first time, having a populated profile is crucial. Again,
from the perspective of the host, they can only base their opinion on what they see:
profile, messages, references. Although I’ve never hosted, I’ve been told by previous hosts of three
profile factors that often contribute to accepting requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>References</strong>: It’s chicken-and-egg, but it’s hard for hosts to host you if no one is vouching
for you. For those starting off, ask any friends who have Couchsurfed in the past to leave a
reference. Another option is to meet up with someone in the local Couchsurfing community and get
a reference.</li>
  <li><strong>“Proof of existence”:</strong> My profile contains a link to this site and my YouTube channel. I’ve had
multiple hosts tell me that simply poking around these links made me more trustworthy.</li>
  <li><strong>Couchsurfing verification:</strong> Couchsurfing has an option to upload and verify your identity for a
fee. One of my previous hosts said that they have a strong preference for verified
profiles. I’ve never done verification, but it helps a lot if your profile is just starting off.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-i-bring-a-gift">Should I bring a gift?</h2>
<p>Gifting is universal across cultures, and I recommend bringing or buying a gift for your host
– even something small like candy. It’s the thought that counts.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I’ve had extremely positive experiences with Couchsurfing and would highly recommend
it to anyone. I’ve made countless great memories through Couchsurfing, but I’ve only had one “bad
experience,” where the host was very controlling. Even that was still fun overall.</p>

<p>In my mind, there are two minor downsides to Couchsurfing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social requirement: during my travels, I sometimes just don’t feel like socializing.</li>
  <li>Less schedule flexibility to go “home.” Since most hosts don’t give you a key, you often have to
coordinate with your host. This is especially bad if you’re jetlagged, and you need to get
creative to find a place to sleep during the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a semi-experienced Couchsurfing guest, but my experience is still a small sample of that of
more experienced individuals, such as the power hosts who have hosted over one hundred guests.</p>

<p>We took a taxi from the airport to McLeod Ganj for 800 rupees, though the exact price depends on the
location of your residence. Go to the prepaid taxi booth and talk to the booth. There will be a number of drivers and a clerk outside of the stand. The drivers may try to
circumvent you from speaking to the booth, ignore them temporarily and get the slip signed off. In

<p>While attending a wedding in Agra, I had to get from Agra to Delhi in the same day in order to catch
a 14:00 flight.  The distance from Agra to Delhi is quite large (3-5 hour drive depending on

<h2 id="traditional-taxi-service">Traditional taxi service</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~4000 rupees</strong></p>

<p>It’s easy to get a bunch of conflicting prices here. Definitely don’t book through a hotel (hostel
will probably give you better price) as they will way overcharge you – hotels’ quoted prices 
were around 200 USD.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297683-d13188303-Reviews-D_K_Car_and_Driver_India-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html">D.K. Car and Driver India</a>, which was the first result on TripAdvisor at the time of our trip. I called him using the hotel phone, but he also responded to my Facebook messages in about an hour, which was advantageous since I was trying to book at 4 PM the day before. Everything went seamlessly, so I’m willing to stick in my endorsement for D.K. here.</p>

<p>We paid around 4000 rupees, which at the time of writing, was about 60 USD. The trip was four hours.</p>

<h2 id="savaari--clearcar--other-taxi-aggregator">Savaari / ClearCar / other taxi aggregator</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~2500 rupees</strong>. The sites don’t give an exact amount, but this is an estimation based on
their formulas for trips over 80km.</p>

<p>There are a number of taxi aggregators in India (Savaari, ClearCar, etc.) that do “outstation” (out of town) trips. These are essentially like Uber, except that you book the car in advance, and it shows up at the specified time. Savaari was suggested by a native Indian
acquaintance of mine, as he was using it to leave Agra after the wedding.</p>

<p>After doing some research of reviews, it
seems that these services aren’t fully reliable; many reviews contained instances of drivers being late,
cancelling the hour beforehand, intentionally taking longer routes, etc. While online reviews are
likely biased toward the bad instances, it does suggest that these services could be hit-or-miss
(although it must be “hit” enough that a native Indian suggested it to us).</p>

<p>Despite being the best balance of convenience and price, I ended up not going with this option due
to the potential time unreliability, especially for a 7AM flight. However, <strong>if you simply want to get from
Agra to Delhi as a group with looser time constraints, Savaari is both cheaper and more convenient
than public transportation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="public-transportation">Public transportation</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~1000 rupees / person.</strong> Air-conditioned class train tickets ranged from 700 to 1200 rupees.</p>

<p>Public transportation here means train, metro, and bus/short-distance cab.  For the trains, view
up-to-date timetables and book tickets at <a href="https://www.irctc.co.in/">IRCTC</a>. I’m not sure if they
take international cards; I’ve seen varying reports online.</p>

<p>In general, public transportation (train/metro) is a good option for Agra to Delhi.</p>

<p>For getting to the airport specifically, it becomes more complicated. We ran into a myriad of issues trying to plan a public transit route. The fastest 2.25 hour express trains from Agra to Delhi ran only in the evening, which didn’t work for our 14:00 flight, so the train would be least 3 hours. Additionally, the trains for our timetable only went to Hazrat Nizmuddin station, which would require either a bus/cab to the airport or airport metro line.</p>

<p>To summarize, the trip would involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Residence in Agra to Agra Cantt station (<strong>10-20 min</strong>)</li>
  <li>Agra Cantt to New Delhi Station or Hazrat Nizmuddin station (<strong>2.25 to 3.5 hours</strong>, depending on what
train you catch)</li>
  <li>If at New Delhi Station, metro to airport. If at Hazrat Nizmuddin station, figure out a way to get
to the airport metro, then head to airport (either way, <strong>30 min to 1 hour</strong>, and traffic is bad).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an evening flight, then public transportation to the airport is a viable
option, as you have more time flexibility without waking up at an ungodly hour. If traveling solo,
this is the cheapest option by far, but if your group
has two or more people and you have time flexibility, a Savaari cab becomes about the same
price per person.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article contains information about the best place to exchange currency in Dubrovnik, Croatia:
<strong>OK Travel Agency</strong>.</p>

<p>Dubrovnik is a popular coastal destination (and the filming site of King’s Landing for the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV
show!).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<p>The travel agency is located at <strong>Obala Stjepana Radića 32, Dubrovnik, Croatia</strong>.</p>

<p>It is very
convenient to reach when arriving in Dubrovonik by bus or boat, because it is located next to the main
port and central bus station.</p>

<p>It is further from Old Town, and you will take one of the buses to the central bus station or
port (most of them stop here), then walk to the agency.</p>

<h2 id="rates">Rates</h2>

<p>I received exchange rates from OK Travel Agency that were <strong>0.8% from
the midmarket rate</strong> (the rate from internet searches). There was <strong>no commission</strong>.</p>

<p>Rates change over time, but in September 2015, the midmarket rate was 7.55 kuna to the euro. I
received 7.49 kuna to the euro. \((1 - 7.49 / 7.55 = 0.079)\)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article describes directions from Tirana, Albania to Ulcinj / Budva / Kotor, Montenegro by bus,
based on my travels in August 2015. It is possible
to start early and arrive in Kotor by the afternoon, but be prepared to wake up early to ride four
buses.</p>

<p>I caught the
first bus at 7:00 and arrived in Kotor around 14:00.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="leg-1-tirana-to-schkoder">Leg 1: Tirana to Schkoder</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> about 1.25 hrs to 1.75 hrs, depending on traffic</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> 500 lek (about €2)</p>

<p>See the <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/tirana-durres-schkoder-albania/">Tirana to Schkoder article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="leg-2-schkoder-to-ulcinj">Leg 2: Schkoder to Ulcinj</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> About 1.25 hours, depending on border control</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €5</p>

<p>The buses (vans) are near the fountain at the city center. Ask around for
Schkoder if nobody is shouting, or ask the driver from Tirana. I asked the driver from Tirana, who
showed me to the next van.
The driver leaves at 9:00, sitting at a cafe and chatting with his friends before then.</p>

<p>Ask the Schkoder-Ulcinj driver to drop you off at the bus stop. The rest is easy –
Montenegro has much more signage for its bus system than Albania does.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget to have your passport ready for border control!</strong></p>

<p>Below is the location of the buses in Schkoder.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="leg-3-ulcinj-to-budva">Leg 3: Ulcinj to Budva</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €7</p>

<p>According to possibly-outdated information from the internet, there are only two buses direct from
Ulcinj to Kotor in a day. It may be possible to catch a bus directly to Kotor; otherwise, head to
Budva.</p>

<p>An alternative option is to go from Ulcinj to Bar, but buses from Bar to Kotor are less frequent.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about the precise schedule, but buses from Ulcinj to Budva should be fairly frequent. 
I arrived from Ulcinj five minutes before a bus was leaving for Budva.</p>

<h2 id="leg-4-budva-to-kotor">Leg 4: Budva to Kotor</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €3</p>

<p>From Budva, buses leave to Kotor every thirty minutes.</p>

<h2 id="fare">Fare</h2>

<p>500 lek + €5 + €7 + €3 = <strong>€18</strong></p>

<p>This is much cheaper than the “direct transfer service” offered by Montenegro Hostel from Tirana to
Kotor (€35).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article contains bus directions based on my travels in Albania in August 2015. 
Durres is a coastal city around thirty minutes away, containing
ferries to Italy and beaches.</p>

<p>Schkoder is a historical city around 1.25 to 1.75 hours away,
depending on traffic. It is a northern border city with bus transfers to Ulcinj, Montenegro.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Confirm these
directions. Two years ago, the bus to Schkoder was at a different location, and some of the
directions that I found were outdated.</p>

<h2 id="directions-to-the-bus-stop">Directions to the bus stop</h2>

<p>The Google Maps diagram below shows the bus stop, which is in the roundabout of Karl Topia Square.
It shouldn’t be too hard to find the correct bus: each bus has a person shouting its destination.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2995.868120776664!2d19.804230999999994!3d41.333481!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zNDHCsDIwJzAwLjUiTiAxOcKwNDgnMTUuMiJF!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1441137271939" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="bus">Bus</h2>

<p>The buses, known as <em>furgons</em>, are more akin to vans or cars. For an afternoon bus to Durres, I took
a van that fit approximately 15 people. For a 7 AM bus to Schkoder, the vehicle was someone’s
five-seat Volkswagen. Don’t be worried if it just seems like you’re getting in someone’s car (you
are).</p>

<p>The buses don’t leave until they are full or almost full. For Durres, this seems to be approximately
every thirty minutes. For Schkoder, this seems to be approximately every hour.</p>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/tiranabus/bus.jpg" alt="Vans that will take you through beautiful Albania" /></p>

<h2 id="fare">Fare</h2>

<p>In August 2015, the fare for each direction was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>150 lek to Durres</li>
  <li>500 lek to Schkoder</li>
</ul>

<p>The drivers take euro. If you want to get rid of some remaining lek, they also take euro-lek mix.</p>

<p>Enjoy the Albanian music on the drive!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294446-d606455-Reviews-Mount_Dajti-Tirana.html">Mount
Dajti</a> is a mountain near Tirana, the capital of Albania. It is a popular picnic
and hiking spot. This article includes directions and information from Tirana
city center to Mount Dajti.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="directions-to-the-cable-car-station">Directions to the cable car station</h2>
<p>The <a href="www.dajtiekspres.com/">Dajti Express</a> cable car is the preferred method of going up. The site does not say its hours of operation, but as of August 2015 it
operates from 9:00 - 22:00.</p>

<p>The cable car station is about 5 km from Skanderbeg Square, the city center.</p>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/view.jpg" alt="View from the cable car, scratched glass and all" /></p>

<h3 id="by-public-bus">By public bus</h3>
<p>The bus waits outside the clock tower near Skanderbeg Square, dropping you off a short, uphill walk from the
cable car station. The bus should say Porcelani on it. It
costs about 100 lek.</p>

<h3 id="by-dajti-express-van">By Dajti Express van</h3>

<p>I couldn’t find information about this on the internet (I suspect nothing has been updated), but on my return trip, there was a <strong>free
van</strong> that
stopped directly at the cable car station at the base of the mountain.</p>

<p>The Google Maps link below shows where it dropped me off outside the cafes near Skanderbeg Square, which is likely where it picks up for a free trip to the cable car
station. If you don’t mind waiting, then you can wait there for a potential free trip by looking for
the van pictured below (and let me know if you’re successful!).  People in Tirana are also very
friendly, and it doesn’t hurt to ask around.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2996.102796304338!2d19.818874999999995!3d41.328378!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zNDHCsDE5JzQyLjIiTiAxOcKwNDknMDguMCJF!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1440968571219" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/van.jpg" alt="The mystery van operated by Dajti Express" /></p>

<h3 id="by-foot-or-bike">By foot or bike</h3>
<p>Since the station is 5 km away from Skanderbeg, running or biking to the station are viable options.</p>

<p>There is some information on the internet about hiking trails from the base of the mountain to the
summit, but I’m not familiar with these routes.</p>

<h2 id="trail-map">Trail Map</h2>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/trails.jpg" alt="Trail map" /></p>

<p>I didn’t find this map very useful, and online reviews say that the trails are not well marked (I
had this impression as well, though I didn’t actually end up hiking – I crashed an Albanian Sunday
barbecue instead).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an English guide for transportation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangmingshan">Yangmingshan
(阳明山)</a>, a national park north of Taipei, Taiwan. 
Yangmingshan is a popular destination for locals and tourists, containing numerous hiking trails and
hot springs.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="travel-to-yangmingshan">Travel to Yangmingshan</h2>

<p>The easiest way to reach Yangmingshan is by taking the <strong>260 bus from Taipei Main Station</strong>
to the very last stop. <strong>The bus stops outside exit M1.</strong> The second-to-last stop also contains the phrase “Yangmingshan” – make
sure to get off at the final stop.</p>

<p>The 260 bus also runs along North Zhongshan Road (中山北路). It may be more convenient to find a 260
bus stop along this road rather than going to Taipei Main Station.</p>

<p><strong>The fare is about 30 NTD</strong>. If using an Easy Card, swipe the card when going both on and off the bus.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a guide to transportation, food, activities, and lodging for a Sun Moon Lake trip, based on
my own experiences. My friend and I traveled from Taipei to Sun Moon Lake in July 2015, staying one
night by the lake.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-to-sun-moon-lake">Traveling to Sun Moon Lake</h2>

<h3 id="from-taichung">From Taichung</h3>

<p>We traveled from Taichung (台中), since we wanted to explore the city the night before.
Taipei to Taichung is one hour by high speed rail (HSR), two hours by train (TRA), four hours by
bus.</p>

<p>We purchased a package deal for Sun Moon Lake from Nantou Bus Company across from Gancheng station,
which is near the train station. Packages can also be purchased from the Taichung HSR station.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.ntbus.com.tw/en-p-1.html">many options for packages</a>, but the 570 NT package
includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round trip bus tickets between Taichung and Sun Moon Lake (383 NT)</li>
  <li>Ferry rides for one day (200 NT)</li>
  <li>Bike rental for two hours from Merida Bikes or one hour from GIANT (200 NT)</li>
  <li>Round trip bus tickets between Shuishe and Xiangshan, two stops at Sun Moon Lake (48 NT)</li>
</ul>

<p>According to my computationally intense calculations, this <strong>saves you 261 NT.</strong> It’s a good deal.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.5 hours<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> 570 NT for package deal (see <a href="http://www.ntbus.com.tw/en-p-1.html">Nantou site</a> for other
options)<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Across from Gancheng station (sells packages), Taichung HSR station (sells packages),
or Taichung TRA station. It stops at Shuishe Pier, the main hub of Sun Moon Lake.</p>

<h2 id="from-taipei">From Taipei</h2>
<p>I didn’t travel from Taipei, but the <a href="http://www.sunmoonlake.gov.tw/English/TravelInfoEng/BusInfo/TaipeiToSML.htm">King Bus
timetable</a> lists bus
times from Taipei Main Station.</p>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Bus<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 4 hours<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> 460 NT each way<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Taipei Bus Station</p>

<p>Miscellaneous: We stayed at a nice and cheap hotel in Taichung, the <a href="https://www.kayak.com/Taichung-Hotels-Moon-Lake-Hotel.2070096.ksp">Moon Lake
Hotel</a> (11 USD per
night). It is less than a kilometer away from the train station.</p>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Bus</p>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

<h3 id="ferry">Ferry</h3>

<p>The ferry is the most convenient way to cover a lot of ground and hit the main destinations. It has three stops, forming a triangle along the lake.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first pier is <strong>Shuishe</strong>, the main pier.</li>
  <li>The second pier is <strong>Xuanzang Pier</strong>, and it has a legendary tea egg store that has been run by the same
woman for about fifty years (13 NT per egg).</li>
  <li>The last pier is <strong>Ita Thao</strong>, which has many food stands.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bike">Bike</h3>

<p>Biking is a scenic way to get around the lake. Details on bike shops can be found
<a href="http://www.sunmoonlake.gov.tw/English/TravelInfoEng/LakeTour/BikeRental.htm">here</a>. See the <strong>Activities</strong> section for more information
about the bikes in the package deal.</p>

<h3 id="bus">Bus</h3>

<p>The Round-the-Lake bus, which goes ‘round the lake, is the main bus. A trip on the bus is more or less 20 NT. An unlimited trip ticket is 80 NT. You can use your EasyCard.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Wave down the bus drivers as they approach, because they probably won’t stop for you
otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="things-to-try">Things To Try</h2>

<h3 id="food">Food</h3>

<p>Ita Thao has all the good food. Edibles to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pork buns (Ita Thao):</strong> I recommend the stand that has pumpkin pork buns.</li>
  <li><strong>Assam tea (Ita Thao):</strong> Stands advertising Assam tea are everywhere. It’s a type of tea imported
  from India or Japan. It tastes like tea. For some reason (I don’t know because I’m Chinese
  illiterate), it’s famous in the area.</li>
  <li><strong>Chicken stuffed with rice (Ita Thao):</strong> I have no idea what this is called. Look for a stand with deer horns.
  Also, if you don’t like spicy, ask for “no spicy” because even “small spicy” was super spicy.</li>
  <li><strong>Old woman tea eggs (Xuanguan Pier):</strong> These were mentioned above. They’re at the first ferry stop after Shuishe.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="places">Places</h3>

<p>There are many destinations at Sun Moon Lake, but I recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ci’en Pagoda</strong>, a tall building commissioned by Chiang-Kai Shek, has a sweeping view of the lake. 
Sun Moon Lake has hiking trails, but many of them don’t have a nice view of the lake. 
To reach the pagoda, take the round-the-lake bus. Although Ci’en Pagoda is not listed as a stop, it <strong>is</strong>
the second-to-last stop before (I think) Xuanzang Temple.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ita Thao</strong>, an area with many food stands. Because food.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> The bus does not stop at Ci’en Pagoda between 1 and 3 PM, and none of the main
piers are within short walking distance (around 5 km). We tried leaving at 1:30 PM.  Not wanting to
wait around for 1.5 hours, we hitchhiked our way back.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Bug your bus driver to stop. Our bus driver was not-too-nice and chose not to stop Ci’en
Pagoda– despite knowing that it was
our destination. You might notice a pattern here involving interactions with bus drivers.</p>

<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Walking</strong>: Self explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>Biking</strong>: The best activity by far. The package that we did gave us bikes for two hours from Merida Bike, which was enough time to bike
about a third of the lake (going out and coming back to the bike rental shop). Renting bikes for
longer (i.e., to go around the whole lake) costs more, but I’m unsure how much more. Bike shops want bikes back by around 6:30 PM.</li>
  <li><strong>Cable car:</strong> It exists, but I didn’t do it.</li>
  <li><strong>Being ignored by bus drivers:</strong> It exists, and I did do it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>None of these were that interesting to us, but if you have more time, this is an incomplete list of
other activities in the area:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Aboriginal Culture Village (<a href="http://www.nine.com.tw/webe/html/information/">link</a>):</strong> This sounds like a village for cultural edification, but it turns
  out it’s actually an amusement park.</li>
  <li><strong>Puli:</strong> It’s a town.</li>
  <li><strong>Cingjing Farm (<a href="http://www.cingjing.gov.tw/en/about/">link</a>):</strong> It’s a farm. It’s about 40 minutes from Sun Moon Lake.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lodging">Lodging</h2>

<p>Because Sun Moon Lake is a popular tourist destination, lodging is relatively expensive.</p>

<p>Super secret hacker budget stay: <strong>Naluisland House</strong>. This place is so secret that it doesn’t show up
on <a href="http://kayak.com">Kayak</a> or have reviews on
<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304160-d6453391-Reviews-Naluisland_House-Nantou.html">TripAdvisor</a>. 
You can book through Agoda or Ctrip.</p>

<p>We shared a room with two queen sized beds between four people, and it came out to about <strong>450 NT
per person</strong> (15
USD in July 2015). Our room was sufficient for a one night stay. There are rooms with four beds for
a little more. Some rooms also have private bathrooms, which costs a little more as well.</p>

<p>To get to Naluisland House, take the ferry or bus to Ita Thao, which is one of the major destinations of Sun Moon
Lake. However, buses and ferries close around 5:30 PM – be very careful to get to Ita Thao before
then. We learned that a taxi from Shuishe, the main port, costs about 500 NT (try negotiating).</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the owner speaks English, but she was very helpful.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/senior-thesis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I submitted my undergraduate thesis at the beginning of April, titled “Security Analysis of Java Web
Applications Using String Constraint Analysis.” I was advised by Professor Stephen Chong.</p>

<p>Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Web applications are exposed to myriad security vulnerabilities related to malicious user string
input. In order to detect such vulnerabilities in Java web applications, this project employs string
constraint analysis, which approximates the values that a string variable in a program can take on.
In string constraint analysis, program analysis generates string constraints – assertions about the
relationships between string variables. We design and implement a dataflow analysis for Java
programs that generates string constraints and passes those constraints to the CVC4 SMT solver to
find a satisfying assignment of string variables. Using example programs, we illustrate the
feasibility of the system in detecting certain types of web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL
injection and cross-site scripting.</p>
