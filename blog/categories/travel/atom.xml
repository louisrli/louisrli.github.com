<p>This post describes what to expect when going from the Dharamshala Airport to MacLeod Ganj,
Dharamshala, India – the central tourist area of Dharamshala.</p>

<p>We took a taxi from the airport to McLeod Ganj for 800 rupees, though the exact price depends on the
location of your residence. Go to the prepaid taxi booth and talk to the booth. There will be a number of drivers and a clerk outside of the stand. The drivers may try to
circumvent you from speaking to the booth, ignore them temporarily and get the slip signed off. In
our case, we ended up getting a lower price confirmed by the booth.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Last updated: June 2018</em></p>

<p>This post describes how to get from <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Agra">Agra, India</a>, to New Delhi,
India. It focuses on how to get to the airport in the same day, though all of the advice applies
more generally to getting from one city to the other.</p>

<p>While attending a wedding in Agra, I had to get from Agra to Delhi in the same day in order to catch
a 14:00 flight.  The distance from Agra to Delhi is quite large (3-5 hour drive depending on
traffic), so I did some research on the most economical methods of reaching the Delhi airport. This
is a summary of my research that will hopefully help other travelers evaluate their options.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="traditional-taxi-service">Traditional taxi service</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~4000 rupees</strong></p>

<p>It’s easy to get a bunch of conflicting prices here. Definitely don’t book through a hotel (hostel
will probably give you better price) as they will way overcharge you – hotels’ quoted prices 
were around 200 USD.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297683-d13188303-Reviews-D_K_Car_and_Driver_India-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html">D.K. Car and Driver India</a>, which was the first result on TripAdvisor at the time of our trip. I called him using the hotel phone, but he also responded to my Facebook messages in about an hour, which was advantageous since I was trying to book at 4 PM the day before. Everything went seamlessly, so I’m willing to stick in my endorsement for D.K. here.</p>

<p>We paid around 4000 rupees, which at the time of writing, was about 60 USD. The trip was four hours.</p>

<h2 id="savaari--clearcar--other-taxi-aggregator">Savaari / ClearCar / other taxi aggregator</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~2500 rupees</strong>. The sites don’t give an exact amount, but this is an estimation based on
their formulas for trips over 80km.</p>

<p>There are a number of taxi aggregators in India (Savaari, ClearCar, etc.) that do “outstation” (out of town) trips. These are essentially like Uber, except that you book the car in advance, and it shows up at the specified time. Savaari was suggested by a native Indian
acquaintance of mine, as he was using it to leave Agra after the wedding. </p>

<p>After doing some research of reviews, it
seems that these services aren’t fully reliable; many reviews contained instances of drivers being late,
cancelling the hour beforehand, intentionally taking longer routes, etc. While online reviews are
likely biased toward the bad instances, it does suggest that these services could be hit-or-miss
(although it must be “hit” enough that a native Indian suggested it to us).</p>

<p>Despite being the best balance of convenience and price, I ended up not going with this option due
to the potential time unreliability, especially for a 7AM flight. However, <strong>if you simply want to get from
Agra to Delhi as a group with looser time constraints, Savaari is both cheaper and more convenient
than public transportation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="public-transportation">Public transportation</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: ~1000 rupees / person.</strong> Air-conditioned class train tickets ranged from 700 to 1200 rupees.</p>

<p>Public transportation here means train, metro, and bus/short-distance cab.  For the trains, view
up-to-date timetables and book tickets at <a href="https://www.irctc.co.in/">IRCTC</a>. I’m not sure if they
take international cards; I’ve seen varying reports online.</p>

<p>In general, public transportation (train/metro) is a good option for Agra to Delhi. </p>

<p>For getting to the airport specifically, it becomes more complicated. We ran into a myriad of issues trying to plan a public transit route. The fastest 2.25 hour express trains from Agra to Delhi ran only in the evening, which didn’t work for our 14:00 flight, so the train would be least 3 hours. Additionally, the trains for our timetable only went to Hazrat Nizmuddin station, which would require either a bus/cab to the airport or airport metro line.</p>

<p>To summarize, the trip would involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Residence in Agra to Agra Cantt station (<strong>10-20 min</strong>)</li>
  <li>Agra Cantt to New Delhi Station or Hazrat Nizmuddin station (<strong>2.25 to 3.5 hours</strong>, depending on what
train you catch)</li>
  <li>If at New Delhi Station, metro to airport. If at Hazrat Nizmuddin station, figure out a way to get
to the airport metro, then head to airport (either way, <strong>30 min to 1 hour</strong>, and traffic is bad).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an evening flight, then public transportation to the airport is a viable
option, as you have more time flexibility without waking up at an ungodly hour. If traveling solo,
this is the cheapest option by far, but if your group
has two or more people and you have time flexibility, a Savaari cab becomes about the same
price per person.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article contains information about the best place to exchange currency in Dubrovnik, Croatia:
<strong>OK Travel Agency</strong>.</p>

<p>Dubrovnik is a popular coastal destination (and the filming site of King’s Landing for the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV
show!). </p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<p>The travel agency is located at <strong>Obala Stjepana Radića 32, Dubrovnik, Croatia</strong>. </p>

<p>It is very
convenient to reach when arriving in Dubrovonik by bus or boat, because it is located next to the main
port and central bus station. </p>

<p>It is further from Old Town, and you will take one of the buses to the central bus station or
port (most of them stop here), then walk to the agency. </p>

<h2 id="rates">Rates</h2>

<p>I received exchange rates from OK Travel Agency that were <strong>0.8% from
the midmarket rate</strong> (the rate from internet searches). There was <strong>no commission</strong>.</p>

<p>Rates change over time, but in September 2015, the midmarket rate was 7.55 kuna to the euro. I
received 7.49 kuna to the euro. <script type="math/tex">(1 - 7.49 / 7.55 = 0.079)</script></p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/tirana-kotor/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-01 00:00:00 +0530</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/tirana-kotor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article describes directions from Tirana, Albania to Ulcinj / Budva / Kotor, Montenegro by bus,
based on my travels in August 2015. It is possible
to start early and arrive in Kotor by the afternoon, but be prepared to wake up early to ride four
buses. </p>

<p>I caught the
first bus at 7:00 and arrived in Kotor around 14:00. </p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="leg-1-tirana-to-schkoder">Leg 1: Tirana to Schkoder</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> about 1.25 hrs to 1.75 hrs, depending on traffic</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> 500 lek (about €2)</p>

<p>See the <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/tirana-durres-schkoder-albania/">Tirana to Schkoder article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="leg-2-schkoder-to-ulcinj">Leg 2: Schkoder to Ulcinj</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> About 1.25 hours, depending on border control</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €5</p>

<p>The buses (vans) are near the fountain at the city center. Ask around for
Schkoder if nobody is shouting, or ask the driver from Tirana. I asked the driver from Tirana, who
showed me to the next van.
The driver leaves at 9:00, sitting at a cafe and chatting with his friends before then. </p>

<p>Ask the Schkoder-Ulcinj driver to drop you off at the bus stop. The rest is easy –
Montenegro has much more signage for its bus system than Albania does.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget to have your passport ready for border control!</strong></p>

<p>Below is the location of the buses in Schkoder.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="leg-3-ulcinj-to-budva">Leg 3: Ulcinj to Budva</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €7</p>

<p>According to possibly-outdated information from the internet, there are only two buses direct from
Ulcinj to Kotor in a day. It may be possible to catch a bus directly to Kotor; otherwise, head to
Budva. </p>

<p>An alternative option is to go from Ulcinj to Bar, but buses from Bar to Kotor are less frequent. </p>

<p>I’m not sure about the precise schedule, but buses from Ulcinj to Budva should be fairly frequent. 
I arrived from Ulcinj five minutes before a bus was leaving for Budva.</p>

<h2 id="leg-4-budva-to-kotor">Leg 4: Budva to Kotor</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €3</p>

<p>From Budva, buses leave to Kotor every thirty minutes.</p>

<h2 id="fare">Fare</h2>

<p>500 lek + €5 + €7 + €3 = <strong>€18</strong></p>

<p>This is much cheaper than the “direct transfer service” offered by Montenegro Hostel from Tirana to
Kotor (€35). </p>
