    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article contains information about the best place to exchange currency in Dubrovnik, Croatia:
<strong>OK Travel Agency</strong>.</p>

<p>Dubrovnik is a popular coastal destination (and the filming site of King’s Landing for the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV
show!). </p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<p>The travel agency is located at <strong>Obala Stjepana Radića 32, Dubrovnik, Croatia</strong>. </p>

<p>It is very
convenient to reach when arriving in Dubrovonik by bus or boat, because it is located next to the main
port and central bus station. </p>

<p>It is further from Old Town, and you will take one of the buses to the central bus station or
port (most of them stop here), then walk to the agency. </p>

</div>

<h2 id="rates">Rates</h2>

<p>I received exchange rates from OK Travel Agency that were <strong>0.8% from
the midmarket rate</strong> (the rate from internet searches). There was <strong>no commission</strong>.</p>

<p>Rates change over time, but in September 2015, the midmarket rate was 7.55 kuna to the euro. I
received 7.49 kuna to the euro. <script type="math/tex">(1 - 7.49 / 7.55 = 0.079)</script></p>

    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/tirana-kotor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article describes directions from Tirana, Albania to Ulcinj / Budva / Kotor, Montenegro by bus,
based on my travels in August 2015. It is possible
to start early and arrive in Kotor by the afternoon, but be prepared to wake up early to ride four
buses. </p>

<p>I caught the
first bus at 7:00 and arrived in Kotor around 14:00. </p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="leg-1-tirana-to-schkoder">Leg 1: Tirana to Schkoder</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> about 1.25 hrs to 1.75 hrs, depending on traffic</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> 500 lek (about €2)</p>

<p>See the <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/tirana-durres-schkoder-albania/">Tirana to Schkoder article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="leg-2-schkoder-to-ulcinj">Leg 2: Schkoder to Ulcinj</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> About 1.25 hours, depending on border control</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €5</p>

<p>The buses (vans) are near the fountain at the city center. Ask around for
Schkoder if nobody is shouting, or ask the driver from Tirana. I asked the driver from Tirana, who
showed me to the next van.
The driver leaves at 9:00, sitting at a cafe and chatting with his friends before then. </p>

<p>Ask the Schkoder-Ulcinj driver to drop you off at the bus stop. The rest is easy –
Montenegro has much more signage for its bus system than Albania does.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget to have your passport ready for border control!</strong></p>

<p>Below is the location of the buses in Schkoder.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="leg-3-ulcinj-to-budva">Leg 3: Ulcinj to Budva</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €7</p>

<p>According to possibly-outdated information from the internet, there are only two buses direct from
Ulcinj to Kotor in a day. It may be possible to catch a bus directly to Kotor; otherwise, head to
Budva. </p>

<p>An alternative option is to go from Ulcinj to Bar, but buses from Bar to Kotor are less frequent. </p>

<p>I’m not sure about the precise schedule, but buses from Ulcinj to Budva should be fairly frequent. 
I arrived from Ulcinj five minutes before a bus was leaving for Budva.</p>

<h2 id="leg-4-budva-to-kotor">Leg 4: Budva to Kotor</h2>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1.25 hours</p>

<p><strong>Fare:</strong> €3</p>

<p>From Budva, buses leave to Kotor every thirty minutes.</p>

<h2 id="fare">Fare</h2>

<p>500 lek + €5 + €7 + €3 = <strong>€18</strong></p>

<p>This is much cheaper than the “direct transfer service” offered by Montenegro Hostel from Tirana to
Kotor (€35). </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article contains bus directions based on my travels in Albania in August 2015. 
Durres is a coastal city around thirty minutes away, containing
ferries to Italy and beaches. </p>

<p>Schkoder is a historical city around 1.25 to 1.75 hours away,
depending on traffic. It is a northern border city with bus transfers to Ulcinj, Montenegro. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Confirm these
directions. Two years ago, the bus to Schkoder was at a different location, and some of the
directions that I found were outdated.</p>

<h2 id="directions-to-the-bus-stop">Directions to the bus stop</h2>

<p>The Google Maps diagram below shows the bus stop, which is in the roundabout of Karl Topia Square.
It shouldn’t be too hard to find the correct bus: each bus has a person shouting its destination.  </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2995.868120776664!2d19.804230999999994!3d41.333481!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zNDHCsDIwJzAwLjUiTiAxOcKwNDgnMTUuMiJF!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1441137271939" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="bus">Bus</h2>

<p>The buses, known as <em>furgons</em>, are more akin to vans or cars. For an afternoon bus to Durres, I took
a van that fit approximately 15 people. For a 7 AM bus to Schkoder, the vehicle was someone’s
five-seat Volkswagen. Don’t be worried if it just seems like you’re getting in someone’s car (you
are).</p>

<p>The buses don’t leave until they are full or almost full. For Durres, this seems to be approximately
every thirty minutes. For Schkoder, this seems to be approximately every hour. </p>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/tiranabus/bus.jpg" alt="Vans that will take you through beautiful Albania" /></p>

<h2 id="fare">Fare</h2>

<p>In August 2015, the fare for each direction was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>150 lek to Durres</li>
  <li>500 lek to Schkoder</li>
</ul>

<p>The drivers take euro. If you want to get rid of some remaining lek, they also take euro-lek mix.</p>

<p>Enjoy the Albanian music on the drive!</p>

    <link href="http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/08/30/mt-dajt-tirana-albania/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-30 00:00:00 +0200</updated>
    <id>http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2015/08/30/mt-dajt-tirana-albania</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294446-d606455-Reviews-Mount_Dajti-Tirana.html">Mount
Dajti</a> is a mountain near Tirana, the capital of Albania. It is a popular picnic
and hiking spot. This article includes directions and information from Tirana
city center to Mount Dajti.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="directions-to-the-cable-car-station">Directions to the cable car station</h2>
<p>The <a href="www.dajtiekspres.com/">Dajti Express</a> cable car is the preferred method of going up. The site does not say its hours of operation, but as of August 2015 it
operates from 9:00 - 22:00. </p>

<p>The cable car station is about 5 km from Skanderbeg Square, the city center. </p>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/view.jpg" alt="View from the cable car, scratched glass and all" /></p>

<h3 id="by-public-bus">By public bus</h3>
<p>The bus waits outside the clock tower near Skanderbeg Square, dropping you off a short, uphill walk from the
cable car station. The bus should say Porcelani on it. It
costs about 100 lek. </p>

<h3 id="by-dajti-express-van">By Dajti Express van</h3>

<p>I couldn’t find information about this on the internet (I suspect nothing has been updated), but on my return trip, there was a <strong>free
van</strong> that
stopped directly at the cable car station at the base of the mountain. </p>

<p>The Google Maps link below shows where it dropped me off outside the cafes near Skanderbeg Square, which is likely where it picks up for a free trip to the cable car
station. If you don’t mind waiting, then you can wait there for a potential free trip by looking for
the van pictured below (and let me know if you’re successful!).  People in Tirana are also very
friendly, and it doesn’t hurt to ask around.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2996.102796304338!2d19.818874999999995!3d41.328378!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zNDHCsDE5JzQyLjIiTiAxOcKwNDknMDguMCJF!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1440968571219" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/van.jpg" alt="The mystery van operated by Dajti Express" /></p>

<h3 id="by-foot-or-bike">By foot or bike</h3>
<p>Since the station is 5 km away from Skanderbeg, running or biking to the station are viable options.</p>

<p>There is some information on the internet about hiking trails from the base of the mountain to the
summit, but I’m not familiar with these routes.</p>

<h2 id="trail-map">Trail Map</h2>

<p class="minipic"><img src="/images/travel/dajti/trails.jpg" alt="Trail map" /></p>

<p>I didn’t find this map very useful, and online reviews say that the trails are not well marked (I
had this impression as well, though I didn’t actually end up hiking – I crashed an Albanian Sunday
barbecue instead).</p>
