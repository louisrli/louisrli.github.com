    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article summarizes my quest to stubbornly run a cheap Dockerized gRPC
server capable of interacting with gRPC Web. I was trying to set up a staging
instance (not a production instance) for my startup.</p>

<p>In this article, you can learn one of two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to deploy Docker containers exposed to the internet for cheap on AWS (price of a
micro instance)</li>
  <li>How to deploy a gRPC web server with Envoy on AWS ECS</li>
</ol>

<p>In this example, we use a TypeScript Node server, but you can generalize it to
any gRPC server.</p>

<p>I’m aware there’s others, but I have AWS credits, and for production, I do, for
better or worse, have brand loyalty to AWS. Eventually, I’d need to figure out how to
deploy there.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I won’t be explaining from scratch, but I’ll assume some basic
knowledge of what gRPC, ECS, EC2, VPCs, and subnets are.</p>

<p>ECS allows you to deploy containers. The service itself is free. However, you
can either use AWS Fargate, which is really, really expensive but really
convenient, or use an EC2 instance to back the containers. Being cheap and also refusing to back down
due to my ego, I decided to forgo the convenience of Fargate and try to see if I
could spin up the containers on a micro instance.</p>

<p>To contact a gRPC server from a web browser, it’s <a href="https://yuku.takahashi.coffee/blog/2019/01/grpc-proxy-for-grpc-web">required to use Envoy
proxy</a>, so
it’s not as simple as spinning up a server.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll be spinning up two containers in one task: the Envoy
proxy and the Node gRPC.</p>

<h2 id="bridge-networking-vs-awsvpc">Bridge networking vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awsvpc</code></h2>
<p>You can find on the internet more details about these modes of networking. I
spent a long time trying to get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awsvpc</code> to work, but it turns out that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60878958/how-to-assign-a-public-ip-to-container-running-in-aws-ecs-cluster-in-ec2-mode">you
can’t assign a public IP to ECS
tasks</a>.
This answer gives two ways to do it, but otherwise, there’s no way to easily
expose the container to the internet.</p>

<p>This is possible with a load balancer. You can have the load balancer be exposed
to public inbound traffic and then direct it into your VPC. But again – I’m trying to spend, at
maximum, $10 a month here. A load balancer is another $10, just for my staging
instance!</p>

<p>In bridge networking, you can map host ports to ports that the container listens
to. We map the same container port to the same host port in this case for
convenience, but this also means that, if your EC2 instance is exposed to the
internet at a certain port, then the ECS container is also exposed to the internet.</p>

<p>In our case, our EC2 instance exposes port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">443</code> (through the security rules).
Our Envoy proxy listens on container port 443 (which is the EC2 instance’s port
443). It forwards to the host port 9090 (NOT the Envoy container port, as
explained in the config below), which is listened to by the Node server.</p>

<h2 id="envoy-dockerfile">Envoy Dockerfile</h2>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--platform=linux/amd64</code> is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73398714/docker-fails-when-building-on-m1-macs-exec-usr-local-bin-docker-entrypoint-sh">required for M1 Macs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="envoy-config">Envoy Config</h2>
<p>The key trick in the Envoy file here is the one with the commented line: using

<p>Make sure to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn dockerbuild</code> with your own build. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dockerbuild</code>, I
skip the step of regenerating the protobufs due to some particular details with
my directory structure, but you could just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn build</code> here. Also note that
my build directory is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build/</code>, though I think this might be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dist/</code> by default.</p>

<p>Either way, you can find on Google how to build an image for your server.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># https://www.andreadiotallevi.com/blog/how-to-create-a-production-image-for-a-node-typescript-app-using-docker-multi-stage-builds

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="ec2-instance">EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>You want to use an ECS compatible AMI. The exact AMI that I’m using is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ami-06502972b2860f143</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amzn2-ami-ecs-hvm-2.0.20230109-x86_64-ebs</code>), which is
the standard Linux one provided by Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>It’s important to set the user data here, as this custom setup is essentially
the trickiest part of not using Fargate. When you set up the instance, there
will be a space for user data, for which you should provide:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=sheets-staging-cluster &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_LOGLEVEL=debug &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS=[\"awslogs\",\"json-file\"]" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="double-checking-the-ecs-config">Double checking the ECS config</h2>
<p>In this section, I’ll give some debugging tips, in case things don’t go in the
ideal way.</p>

<p>Be careful with the quoting here. If you’re running into issues related to
missing attributes, you should SSH to the instance to check the ECS config:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat /etc/ecs/ecs.config
ECS_CLUSTER=sheets-staging-cluster
ECS_LOGLEVEL=debug
ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS=["awslogs","json-file","syslog"]
ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can manually change the config of the instance, but you may need to restart
the ECS agent:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl stop ecs &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start ecs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, you can actually check what environmental variables the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ecs-agent</code> has
configured:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker inspect ecs-agent | grep Env -A 15
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="ecs-task-definition">ECS Task Definition</h2>
<p>Create an ECS cluster in your desired region. Upload your Docker images to
Amazon (steps not included in this article). We’re going to create a task
definition, and then instantiate a service using it.</p>

<p>You can use the UI to set up something with the ports as you desire. I’ve also
included the JSON version of my task definition below. The important things are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two containers: one for Envoy, one for Node</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_awslogs.html">Automatic log
  configuration</a> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awslogs</code> as the log driver</li>
  <li>Bridge networking mode</li>
  <li>Required ports</li>
</ul>

<p>The logs are optional, but I highly recommend it, because I (like many people)
ran into issues with my containers that might have been different than when
running them locally. For example, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73398714/docker-fails-when-building-on-m1-macs-exec-usr-local-bin-docker-entrypoint-sh">I was building them on an M1
Mac</a>.
Without logging, you won’t be able to see these errors, and your tasks will
randomly fail.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the log configuration, at the time of writing, can only
be set via UI on the initial creation of the task definition, and if you choose
to edit the task later, you need to type it in using the JSON.</p>

<h3 id="error-when-setting-up-logging">Error when setting up logging</h3>

<p>It ended up being a huge headache for me, because if you don’t configure the EC2
instance properly, you’ll see an error that says something like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>is missing an attribute required by your task
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The internet suggests using the ECS CLI to check attributes, but for me, it said
that all attributes were fine. The error
message itself, unfortunately, is not very clear. What it really means is that you haven’t allowed the correct log drivers on the EC2 instance.</p>

<p>If you are still seeing this message, then you should double check:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you’re not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awsvpc</code> networking (in which case your security group might be wrong)</li>
  <li>that you set up the user data in the EC2 instance correctly above</li>
  <li>the user data declares the allowable log drivers correctly</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE</code> is <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/issues/1395">set</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-https">Setting up HTTPS</h2>
<p>Depending on what frontend you’re using, you may need to set up HTTPS on the EC2
instance. Since I’m still not at the stage of a production deployment, I decided
to skip this again by hosting a Next.js website on S3 (without
HTTPS). For example, Vercel and Netlify weren’t working for me, because they are
<em>too</em> secure, and all their websites have HTTPS, which means they’re not allowed
to use HTTP to contact an endpoint.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another title of this post would be: for protocol buffers in web clients, which
TypeScript protocol buffer libraries are well-documented, and which ones are
badly documented?</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll talk about the mess that’s the open source TypeScript
protocol buffer ecosystem. For historical reasons, based on various libraries
that were released when others didn’t exist, there are some libraries that work
with each other, some that are outdated, etc. In general, this happens quite
commonly in the open source ecosystem, and I hope this post helps others.</p>

<p>The TLDR, if you want to use protocol buffers with the browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code></a> and
 <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code></a></li>
  <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use <a href="https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng/grpc-web</code></a></li>
</ul>

<!-- more -->

<p>My recommendations don’t even have to do with the functionality necessarily;
<strong>they’re about the documentation</strong>. Note that documentation doesn’t
just mean READMEs but also code examples, which are notably missing from the
ones that I suggest not to use.</p>

<p>One disclaimer: perhaps for other side use cases those 
libraries are well-documented. For the particular use case of web RPCs,
they are lacking.</p>

<p>The rest of the post is mostly an explanation of my findings of the current
state of TypeScript protobuf tools. If you just want to know which tools to
use, trust me on the TLDR, and skip the rest of the post.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I wanted to make a simple demo of a TypeScript React client connecting to a
TypeScript Node backend.</p>

<p>I used to work at Google for four years, and like
everyone who’s worked at Google (there’s even a derisive term “proto pusher” to
sometimes the mindless work of protos), I’ve used protocol buffers extensively. I’m not
claiming to be the world’s foremost expert on protocol buffers or that I should
be able to understand anything about protos instantly, but I just want to make
the point: I’ve used them to set up web flows, data pipelines, clients and
servers from scratch, etc. With a foundational knowledge of
protobufs and how they’re transmitted, I should, in theory, be able to find some
documentation and set up a basic “Hello World” RPC quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, documentation is different inside and outside of Google, but that’s
the point of this post. Given the wild environment of various solutions created
at various times, I hope to provide an explanation of what works (until this
post becomes outdated, of course).</p>

<p>In short: after spending five hours desperately searching for documentation to
use the combination I said not to use (which have higher number of stars on
GitHub), I set up a working end-to-end connection in 20 minutes using the
combination that I said to use (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code>) because of <strong>good
documentation</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="points-of-confusion">Points of confusion</h2>

<h3 id="type-generation">Type generation</h3>

<p>You have protocol buffers, which define a contract for entities that you want to
work with. Now you want to generate Typescript types from those protos.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there exist two main open source options for type
generation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code></a> (has more stars)</li>

</ul>

<p>I think there’s also now TypeScript generation built into the official <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protoc</code>,
but again, the documentation in this world is so obfuscated that I only figured
that out from reading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code> example code five directories deep in the
repository.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code> is the clear winner here, simply because of
<a href="[https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/blob/master/MANUAL.md](https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/blob/master/MANUAL.md)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MANUAL.md</code></a>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MANUAL.md</code> , while quite long, has stellar examples for use cases on both
the client- and server- sides. On top of that, there is a <strong>whole folder</strong> of
<a href="https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/tree/master/packages">actual code examples</a>,
while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code>, from what I’ve seen in some responses to the issues, asks you
read their <a href="https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto/tree/main/integration">integration
tests</a> (possible,
but more difficult than parsing real code examples).</p>

<p>The author of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code> has written a <a href="https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts/issues/89">summary of the differences between
these two libraries</a>,
although to be
honest, my currently visualized use case is basic enough that none of these will
likely matter to me. As someone newly figuring out the integrations in the
TypeScript protobuf world, I can recommend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code> solely due to its
documentation.</p>

<h3 id="client-side-grpc-client">Client-side GRPC Client</h3>

<p>There are two identically named repositories: <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng/grpc-web</code></a>.
The former is created by Google, and the second by another company. However, the
second one is in maintenance mode with the recommendation to use the official
one, which <a href="[https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web)">wasn’t even posted on the repo until I made a
PR</a>
(the maintainer had been warning people on the repo’s issues).</p>

<p>For technical reasons (Google it if you’re curious), using GRPC in the browser requires
a proxy. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng/grpc-web</code> library requires their own Go binary as a
proxy, which, upon realizing this, I immediately surmised that it would be
a nightmare to figure out how to deploy some random Go proxy if I
wanted to combine it with other things like AWS Lambda, etc. As expected, the 
<a href="https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/blob/master/go/grpcwebproxy/README.md">documentation for the proxy</a>
is scant. I didn’t think that the documentation for deploying
would be promising either, and as expected, there’s little guidance there,
except for a few GitHub issues.</p>

<p>In contrast, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code> suggests using <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>
as a proxy, which is quite well-known, well-maintained, and well-documented.
It has Docker support, and is, in general, more well-vetted.</p>

<p>I initially tried the following combination: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng/grpc-web</code>. Both seemed popular. After getting a semi-working example using these two libraries, I then wanted to try the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code> and official <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code> combinations (moving off the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng</code> due to the aforementioned proxy). From the <a href="https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto#supported-options">supported options</a>
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code>, it supports
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">improbable-eng/grpc-web</code>, but not the official Google <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code>.</p>

<p>It seems strange that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code> wouldn’t integrate with the official
Google library. Or maybe it does? But that’s the point — perhaps it does support it, but
<strong>the documentation isn’t there</strong>. I couldn’t find any code examples, any flag
documentation, any references, and I couldn’t figure out how to get the types to
work on my own by digging into the generated types (admittedly due to my own
lack of knowledge but hey, that’s the point of Hello World examples).</p>

<p>And if it is really true that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code> doesn’t work with the official,
Google-released version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code>, then it suggests that the tool may
be outdated. Perhaps that version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grpc/grpc-web</code> didn’t exist then, but in any
case, the documentation should clarify this. The only reference I found to this
was <a href="https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto/discussions/422">this answer from the maintainer</a>
about how the library predates gRPC, if I understood the post correctly.</p>

<h3 id="server-side">Server-side</h3>

<p>For writing a TypeScript Node server, there does exist decent documentation for
vanilla JavaScript. I just Googled some tutorials and tried to write a TypeScript
version of the <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/languages/node/basics/">official tutorial</a>.
Using both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-proto</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protobuf-ts</code> here worked fine. Ultimately, I only ran into
problems with client-side web RPC typing. Nonetheless, you would want to use
the same generator for both the server and client side.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, documentation. But also, if you are in a similar boat to me and
want to get started with a basic hello world, TypeScript gRPC web client and
server, I suggest using the two libraries I talked about.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that this post does not mean to detract from the work of
these open source contributors. Each of these libraries, at some point in time,
had their crucial role in the ecosystem.</p>
