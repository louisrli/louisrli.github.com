<p>This post talks about the concept of “fiilimsi”, which are nouns, adjectives, or
adverbs derived from verbs. In English, for example, these include gerunds
(“<em>Running</em> is fun”) or participle adjectives (“The dog <em>that I saw</em>”).</p>

<p>This post is not intended to be a comprehensive resource of all fiilimsi.
There are three categories of fiilimsi:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>isim-fiil</strong>: verbal noun</li>
  <li><strong>sıfat-fiil</strong>: verbal adjective</li>
  <li><strong>zarf-fiil</strong>: verbal adverb</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a noticeable lack of English language resources on the internet about
certain Turkish language topics. In fact, Googling “Turkish fiilimsi” with the
language constrained to English doesn’t yield a single result other than some
forum posts. I hope this post fills that niche.</p>

<p>Almost all of this material was derived from a lesson on the <a href="https://discord.me/turkceogrenelim">Türkçe Öğrenelim
Discord</a>. Feel free to join the community

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This post is not intended for complete beginners of Turkish grammar. Fiilimsi
builds on many of the foundations of Turkish grammar. This post assumes
prerequisite familiarity in the following topics,
and as such will not be explaining any of the following in example
sentences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Possessive</li>
  <li>Buffer letters, consonant mutation, vowel harmony</li>
  <li>Infinitive form</li>
  <li>Subjects and objects in Turkish</li>
</ul>

<p>There are sentence examples and grammar derivations that utilize the following,
though it’s possible to grasp the basic idea without a strong understanding of
these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple present tense, past tense</li>
  <li>Dative, locative, accusative cases</li>
  <li>Future tense</li>
  <li>Reported past tense</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="isim-fiil-verbal-nouns">Isim-fiil: Verbal nouns</h1>

<h2 id="makmek-infinitive-as-a-subject">-mak/mek: Infinitive as a subject</h2>

<p>Infinitives are the “dictionary form” of a verb ending with <strong>-mak/mek</strong>, e.g.,
bakmak (to look).</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The verbal noun infinitive form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used as subject</li>
  <li>cannot be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension">declined</a> – that is, no
suffixes are added to it</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqIEiUv1bVQ">a line from this song</a>)  </p>

  <p><strong>Eğlenmek</strong> güzel şey.<br />
<strong>To have fun</strong> is a beautiful thing / <strong>having fun</strong> is a beautiful thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that there are many other uses of the infinitive, but here
we’re talking only about its usage as a noun derived from a verb.</p>

<h2 id="mame-gerund-form">-ma/me: Gerund form</h2>

<p>The gerund form is constructed by adding <strong>-ma/-me</strong> to the verb root
(alternatively, one can think of simply removing the <strong>k</strong> from the infinitive).</p>

<ul>
  <li>yap<strong>ma</strong> (doing)</li>
  <li>bak<strong>ma</strong> (looking)</li>
  <li>sor<strong>ma</strong> (sormak)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usage-1">Usage</h3>
<p>The gerund form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used as object</li>
  <li>can be declined</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>Kitap <strong>okuma</strong>yı seviyorum.<br />
I love reading books.</p>

  <p>Dans <strong>etme</strong>ye başladım.<br />
I started dancing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: The <em>-ma/-me</em> suffix is also used for the negative conjugation, but do
not confuse it with the gerund construction. They can actually stack, for
example <strong>anla-ma-ma</strong> is the noun “not understanding” (<strong>anlamak</strong> – to
understand).</p>

<h3 id="declension-exception-ablative">Declension exception: ablative</h3>
<p>There is one exception where we use the infinitive instead; for the ablative
form (<strong>-dan/den</strong>), we still use the infinitive form. This also violates the
“no declension infinitive” rule. In the example below, eğlenmekten is the
object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p><strong>Eğlenmekten</strong> keyif alırım.<br />
I enjoy having fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likely this is because the gerund form causes ambiguity with
<strong>-meden/-madan</strong> (eğlenmeden), which is also a verbal adverb suffix.</p>

<h3 id="declension-exception-locative">Declension exception: locative</h3>

<p>The locative can also be used interchangeably in some contexts. In the example
below, both are valid uses of the verbal noun as an object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>Böyle yap<strong>mada</strong> sorun yok.<br />
Böyle yap<strong>makta</strong> sorun yok.<br />
There is no problem in doing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you cannot use the genitive suffixes with the infinitive, so for the
example sentence below, there is only one valid construction (yap-ma-n-da, with
the n coming from the second-person genitive).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>Böyle yap<strong>manda</strong> sorun yok.<br />
There is no problem in your doing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize, you cannot use the accusative, dative, or genitive suffixes with
the infinitive, but you can use the ablative and locative.</p>

<h2 id="native-speaking-gerund-and-infinitive">Native speaking: gerund and infinitive</h2>
<p>There’s a tricky exception that’s technically not correct but will be seen in
daily speech. People add (gerund + possessed) suffixes as a way of
creating a verbal noun in lieu of <strong>both the gerund and infinitive forms above</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Denizde <strong>yüzmek</strong> eğlenceli. (gramatically correct)<br />
Denizde <strong>yüzmesi</strong> eğlenceli. (seen in daily speech)<br />
<strong>Swimming</strong> in the sea is fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have <strong>yüz-me-si</strong>, which adds the gerund and possessed
suffixes, respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Object example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Denizde <strong>yüzmeyi</strong> seviyorum.<br />
Denizde <strong>yüzmesini</strong> seviyorum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have <strong>yüz-me-si-n-i</strong>, which adds the gerund, possessed,
-n- possessed buffer, and accusative suffixes, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="siu-the-way-of">-ıs/iş/uş/üş: “the way of”</h2>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: “the way of” is not always the exact meaning of this suffix; it
can vary phrase by phrase. However, it can give a general idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>yap<strong>ış</strong> (the way of doing)</li>
  <li>bak<strong>ış</strong> (the way of looking)</li>
  <li>sor<strong>uş</strong> (the way of asking)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two words derived in this manner that are very common on signs: giriş
and cıkış (entrance and exit).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>Bana <strong>bakışını</strong> sevmiyorum. <br />
I don’t like the way you looked at me.</p>

  <p>Onun <strong>çıkışını</strong> gördün mü? <br />
Did you see how he left? / Did you see the way he left?</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="sfat-fiil-verbal-adjectives">Sıfat-fiil: Verbal adjectives</h1>

<h2 id="yan-en-subject-participles">-(y)an/-en: Subject participles</h2>
<p>In English, you’ll see this grammar concept associated with the terms relative
clause and participle.</p>

<p>We use these to form a verbal adjective that describes a noun.
It is called the subject participle because the described noun is the subject
performing the action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>evime gel<strong>en</strong> misafir<br />
the guest <strong>who comes / is coming / came</strong> to my house</p>

  <p>uyu<strong>yan</strong> adam <br />
the man <strong>who sleeps / is sleeping / slept</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>

<p>Negation works as one might expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>uyu<strong>mayan</strong> adam<br />
the man <strong>who is not sleeping</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In practice, the -y- buffer will always be there since <strong>-ma/me</strong> end
with a vowel.</p>

<h3 id="tense">Tense</h3>
<p>The tense is implied by context. It can take the present continuous, simple
past, and simple present (aka wide present) tenses.</p>

<h2 id="dik-and-possessor-suffix-object-participles">-dIk and possessor suffix: Object participles</h2>

<p>Recall that <strong>-dIk notation</strong> indicates it could be <strong>-dık -dik -duk -dük</strong>. The
d also mutates to t when appropriate (consonant mutation).</p>

<p>This adjective is called the object participle, because the noun described by
the verbal adjective is the object of the verb. Because of this, we also need to
specify who is performing the action of the verb; this is done by the possessor
ending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong>  </p>

  <p>oku<strong>duğum</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that I read / am reading / read (in the past)</strong></p>

  <p>oku<strong>duğun</strong> kitap<br />
the book <strong>that you read (…same tenses)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In practice, the <strong>k</strong> in <strong>-dIk</strong> always mutates to a <strong>ğ</strong> since all
of the possessor endings start with a vowel.</p>

<h3 id="negation-1">Negation</h3>
<p>Negation again works as one would expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>bak<strong>madığım</strong> adam<br />
the man <strong>who I am not looking at</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tense-1">Tense</h3>
<p>The tense is implied by context. It can take the present continuous, simple
past, and simple present (aka wide present) tenses.</p>

<h3 id="usage-with-sonra">Usage with sonra</h3>

<p>You will also see this suffix used with the word sonra (“after”), but without the
possessed ending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>O kahvaltı yap<strong>tıktan sonra</strong> bir sigara içer.<br />
After eating breakfast, he smokes a cigarette.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, it is not symmetrically used with önce, which uses the <strong>-mAdAn</strong>
suffix with verbs with our previously described gerund form.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Uyu<strong>madan önce</strong> kitap okurum.<br />
Before sleeping, I read books.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="future-and-reported-past-participles">Future and reported past participles</h2>
<p>Building upon the two forms we learned above, we can create both object and
subject participles using the suffixes of both the future and reported past tenses. These tenses
won’t be covered here, so this section can be skipped if the reader is not
familiar with them.</p>

<p>Understanding of these derivations follow easily with an understanding of the
<strong>-acak/ecek</strong> future suffixes and the <strong>-mış/miş/muş/müş</strong> reported past
suffixes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (future tense)</strong>  </p>

  <p>konuşacak adam<br />
the man who will speak</p>

  <p>konuşacağı adam<br />
the man he/she will talk to</p>

  <p>adam konuşacak<br />
the man will talk (normal future tense)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (reported past tense)</strong>  </p>

  <p>kitap <strong>okumuş</strong> çocuk<br />
the child <strong>who (apparently) read</strong> books</p>

  <p><strong>boşanmış</strong> kadın<br />
the woman <strong>who (apparently) was divorced</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-verbal-adjectives">Other verbal adjectives</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of other verbal adjectives, often with different meaning.
There’s a <a href="https://www.dilbilgisi.net/fiilimsi-konu-anlatimi/">Turkish page</a>
containing some of them here, but they’re less important and often vary in
meaning phrase-by-phrase.</p>

<h1 id="zarf-fiil-verbal-adverbs">Zarf-fiil: Verbal adverbs</h1>
<p>This is not intended to comprehensively cover all zarf-fiil, but it covers a
few of the most common ones.</p>

<h2 id="eliali-since">-eli/ali: Since</h2>
<p>This suffix means “since” in the sense of time passing (not “since” as in the word “because”, which can also be used in English).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Okuldan <strong>geleli</strong> beş saat oldu.<br />
It has been five hours <strong>since I came</strong> from the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="subject-of-the-since-clause">Subject of the since-clause</h3>
<p>The subject is optional, but it can be used to clarify the subject of the since-clause when it cannot be derived from context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples (with pronoun)</strong>  </p>

  <p><strong>Sen</strong> okuldan gel<strong>eli</strong> beş saat oldu.<br />
It has been five hours since <strong>you</strong> came from the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="madanmeden-before-with-nce--without">-madan/meden: before (with önce) / without</h2>

<h3 id="meaning-without">Meaning “without”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Maske <strong>takmadan</strong> dışarı çıkmak yasaktır.<br />
It is forbidden to go out <strong>without wearing</strong> a mask.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="meaning-before">Meaning “before”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Ben polisi aramadan buradan ayrıl.<br />
Leave this place before I call the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="with-nce">With önce</h4>
<p>In the section on -dIk, it was explained that “sonra verb + dIktAn” could be used to say something that happened after an action. The -madan/meden suffix serves is often seen with <em>önce</em>. With or without önce is essentially the same (to my understanding).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Çalışmaya başla<strong>madan önce</strong> bir kahve içerim.<br />
Before studying, I drink a coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="madan-meden-modifying-a-negative-verb">-madan/-meden modifying a negative verb</h4>
<p>There is a second construction using -madan/-meden. In this one, if the modified verb is negative, then the adverb happens first in the sequence of events. This is a bit confusing to explain but easily clarified with equivalent examples. Note the negative suffix in the verbs below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Kitap <strong>okumadan</strong> yat<strong>ma</strong>dı.<br />
Kitap okudu ve yattı. (equivalent)<br />
I read a book before I slept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A direct English translation can be a bit weird due to the negatives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Siz ne <strong>yapmadan</strong> okula gitmiyorsunuz?<br />
What do you <strong>do before</strong> going to school?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example could literally be translated as, “you don’t go to school before
doing what?”</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=V_bC-hn7cC8">This video</a> (in Turkish, albeit slow
Turkish) is a good explanation of this negative construction. Credit goes to
this video for the examples above.</p>

<h2 id="ar--maz---er--mez-as-soon-as">-ar -maz / -er -mez: as soon as</h2>
<p>Note that the title isn’t precisely correct, the set of suffixes is the same as
those used in the simple present tense, which has a ruleset not within the scope
of this article. One can think of this construction as simply the positive and
negative simple present tense third person forms in succession.</p>

<p>Like -eli/ali, the subject is implied by context, but can optionally be
clarified by a pronoun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>(Biz) <strong>Dışarıya çıkar çıkmaz</strong> yağmur başladı.<br />
<strong>As soon as we went out,</strong> it started to rain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example constructions</strong>  </p>

  <p>yapar yapmaz<br />
gelir gelmez<br />
görür görmez</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="yarakerek-by">-(y)arak/erek: “by”</h2>
<p>This adverb indicates that something was achieved in a certain manner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Türkçe <strong>öğrenerek</strong> ne yapmayı planlıyorsun?<br />
What do you plan to do <strong>by learning</strong> Turkish?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good way to remember this is the word <strong>bilerek</strong>, which means “on purpose.”
But with the literal translation of the suffix, it would mean “by knowing.”</p>

<h2 id="negation-2">Negation</h2>
<p>Simply add -ma/-me with a y buffer. For example, <strong>istemeyerek</strong>
(unintentionally, reluctantly, “by not wanting”).</p>

<h2 id="pipupp-two-actions-in-succession">-ıp/ip/up/üp: two actions in succession</h2>
<p>Again, notice that the subject is implied in the example sentence below. The
suffixed verb is the one that occurs first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Konuyu <strong>anlatıp pratik</strong> yapacağız.<br />
We will explain the subject and then do practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, there is only one usage of -ip in a sentence.</p>

<h3 id="ip-durmak-idiom">-ip durmak: idiom</h3>
<p><strong>-ip durmak</strong> means to keep doing something all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

  <p>Öksürüp duruyor.<br />
He’s constantly coughing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="difference-from-sonradan">Difference from sonradan</h3>
<p>Sonradan (“afterwards”) can ostensibly express the same set of sentences, but
the connotation is slightly different. With -ip, the implication is that one
thing happened very quickly after another, while with sonradan, the time gap
could be wider.</p>

<h2 id="further-reference">Further reference</h2>
<p>The end of Unit 10 in <em>The Delights of Learning Turkish</em> is a decent English
language resource for these verbal adverbs.</p>
