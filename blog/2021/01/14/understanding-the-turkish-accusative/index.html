<p>The purpose of this post is to answer: “when do I use or not use the Turkish
accusative?” Most resources on the accusative describe it as a case ending
applied to a definite direct object. Some say it’s the equivalent of when you
use “the” in English. I found these definitions to be vague and often actively
misleading.</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>This post is not intended for complete beginners of Turkish grammar. It will not
explain any constructions or cover the basics of the accusative; there are ample
other resources.</p>

<h1 id="why-this-post">Why this post?</h1>

<p>Finding a comprehensive resource for the accusative tops the list of
my frustrations in learning Turkish (thankfully the Discord exists). I haven’t found a single public resource on the internet that goes in-depth into accusative usage. All of them try to summarize it in a single sentence by
providing some type of rule or guideline – this guideline is usually ambiguous
or incomplete. That is to say, <strong>if your goal is to use the accusative in all
scenarios without making mistakes</strong>, no existing online resource achieves this.</p>

<p>My hope is that this article will get you close to there, though I can’t promise
that I know Turkish well enough to cover all cases. The most thorough resource that I know would be the discussions in <em>Turkish: A
  Comprehensive Grammar</em>. I’d say, however, that one gets
  <em>too</em> detailed at some point. It’s worth a read if you care about this though.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-incomplete-accusative-definitions">Examples of incomplete accusative definitions</h2>

<p>Below are some examples from different sources in defining the accusative.
I’ve included these to contrast how trusting these definitions can lead learners
astray. Thinking of the accusative as the case for
definite direct objects is not incorrect, but it certainly isn’t comprehensive. <strong>The
purpose of this article is to cover cases where the “direct object” definition
does not suffice.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Nouns that are affected by the action of a verb use the accusative case.”</em>
(<a href="https://www.turkishaholic.com/lessons/free/turkish-case-markers/">Turkishaholic</a>)</li>
  <li><em>“In Turkish, the direct object gets a suffix when it is definite. The direct
object is definite when it refers to a specific object or a specific
collection of objects that is known to the addressee.”</em>
(<a href="https://elon.io/learn-turkish/lesson/the-accusative-case-suffix#:~:text=In%20Turkish%2C%20the%20definite%20direct,to%20prevent%20two%20consecutive%20vowels.">elon.io</a>).</li>
  <li><em>“This is used for direct objects - the object that is receiving an action (the
apple begin eaten, the wine being drunk, etc.). Note that cases only apply
for things that have “the” in front of them in English (as the nominative
covers ones that don’t).”</em> (<a href="https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Turkish_Skill:Accusative">Duolingo Wiki – ew</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="with-plurals">With plurals</h1>

<p>The definitions above all seem to apply that the accusative provides
specificity, but with plurals, its role is reversed. For most cases, adding the
accusative makes a plural general; the lack of accusative makes it specific.</p>

<p>To put it another way, to express a general group, there are two options: plural
with the accusative or singular nominative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Plural accusative vs singular nominative</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Insanları</strong> tanımayı seviyorum.<br />
<strong>Insan</strong> tanımayı seviyorum.<br />
I like to get to know people (people, as a general group).</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>Gömlekleri</strong> sever misin?<br />
<strong>Gömlek</strong> sever misin?<br />
Would you / do you like shirts (generally speaking of shirts)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A plural without the accusative is specific:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Plural without accusative, specific</strong></p>

  <p>Dün ona yeni <strong>gömlekler</strong> aldık.<br />
Yesterday, we bought some new (specific) shirts for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there are some cases where plural accusative is specific rather than
general. I’m actually not sure what the rule is that distinguishes the example
above or below. If you know, then please let me know, and I’ll update this section.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Plural accusative, specific</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Gömlekleri</strong> sevdin mi?<br />
Did you like the (specific) shirts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, this counters the oversimplified definition that the accusative is used
to mark a definite object. The definition of the accusative as parallel to
English “the” is especially egregious to me.</p>

<p>To close it off, as expected by the simple definitions of accusative, using it
with the singular makes the object specific, not general (note that
there are again exceptions that are so detailed it’s not worth mentioning here, see <em>Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar</em> 22.4.3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Singular accusative vs singular nominative</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Gömleği</strong> sever misin?<br />
Would you / do you like the (specific) shirt?</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>Gömlek</strong> sever misin?<br />
Would you / do you like shirts (generally speaking of shirts)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/337748083855327232/337749314036039692/710448813524910291">This
discussion</a>
on the Turkish Discord is useful (and this section is borrowed from there).</p>

<h1 id="with-numbers">With numbers</h1>

<p>Most beginners of Turkish learn the rule, “no accusatives with bir or numbers.”
However, this turns out, again, to be an oversimplification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Indefinite numbered items</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Bir çocuk</strong> gördüm.<br />
I saw <strong>a child</strong>.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>Iki kitap</strong> aldım.<br />
I bought <strong>two books</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="referring-to-specific-objects-in-context">Referring to specific objects in context</h2>

<p>The accusative can be used with numbers when referencing a specific object that
is previously referred to in context.</p>

<p>For example, when you delete a message on Facebook, it says: “Bir mesajı
sildin.” You had previously clicked this message; you know exactly which message
is being deleted.</p>

<p>As explained on the Turkish Discord:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Accusative with bir</strong></p>

  <p>Bir <strong>mesaj</strong> sildin<br />
You deleted a message (just any message)</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Bir <strong>mesajı</strong> sildin<br />
You deleted a message (that specific one)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example adapted from <em>Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar</em>, 14.3.3.2, uses
the accusative when the books were referenced and known to the
listener as part of the first sentence, which can be thought of as a form of
definiteness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Referencing items in context</strong></p>

  <p>Kitaplarımı bana verdi, ama <strong>iki kitabı</strong> unuttu.<br />
He gave me my books, but he forgot <strong>two of them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="with-the-possessive-but-not-compound-nouns">With the possessive (but not compound nouns)</h2>

<p>When using the possessive with a number, it will still take the accusative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Possessive, number, and accusative</strong></p>

  <p>Bir <strong>kıtabımı</strong> ona verdi.<br />
I gave him a book of mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that without the possessive, there is no accusative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Non-possessive with number</strong></p>

  <p>Bir <strong>kitap</strong> ona verdi.<br />
I gave him a book.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="with-question-words">With question words</h1>

<p>The accusative form of question words such as ne (“what”) and kim (“who”) will
occasionally be seen. This can be used more specifically in place of a word that
would normally take that spot in the sentence with the accusative. It often
makes sense in response to somebody.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p>Ne yaptın?<br />
What did you do?</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>Neyi</strong> yaptın?<br />
You did <strong>what</strong>?</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Kimi aradın?<br />
Who did you call?</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>A</strong>: Zaten biliyorum.<br />
I already know.<br />
<strong>B</strong>: <strong>Neyi</strong> biliyorsun?<br />
<strong>What (exactly)</strong> do you know?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Bu bilgiyi biliyorum.<br />
I already know this information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the last example, I don’t think that saying “ne biliyorsun” would necessarily be
incorrect, but neyi offers a certain amount of precision, in response to the
verb (biliyorum) that speaker A used.</p>

<h1 id="with-verbal-nouns">With verbal nouns</h1>

<p>For example, when using any verbal nouns, such as <strong>yüzme</strong> or <strong>yaptığın</strong>,
these will take the accusative if the verb requires it. As far as I know, these
will not appear without the accusative (again, under the “direct object
definition”, this was confusing to me. What does it mean for a verbal noun to be
definite?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Yüzmeyi</strong> biliyorum.<br />
I know how to swim / I know <strong>swimming</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost all Turkish learners will learn how to express wanting to do a verb. This
could be considered to an exception to the verbal noun accusatives above (since
the infinite is considered a noun). However, there’s an exception to the
exception!</p>

<p>When another word appears between the infinite and istemek, then it takes on the
accusative -mA form rather than the infinite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>istemek can take the accusative</strong></p>

  <p>Seni dövmek istiyorum.<br />
I want to beat you up.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Seni dövme<strong>yi</strong> <strong>çok</strong> istiyorum.<br />
I really want to beat you up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="accusative-and-distance-from-the-verb">Accusative and distance from the verb</h1>

<p>This is actually a more general rule for the above. A word cannot be in the
nominative and far from the verb. For example, observe the insertion of the word
<em>çok</em> below and in the previous example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wrong</strong></p>

  <p>Kedi çok seven bir köpek<br />
A dog that loves cats</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Correct</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Kedi</strong> seven bir köpek<br />
A dog that loves <strong>cats</strong></p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong>Kediyi</strong> çok seven bir köpek<br />
A dog that really loves cats</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="you-just-have-to-know">“You just have to know”</h1>

<p>There are some cases where you just have to know that the accusative is
required or not. For example, as a foreigner, one of your most common phrases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A common phrase</strong></p>

  <p>Türkçe biliyor musun?<br />
Do you know Turkish?</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Türkçe biliyorum.<br />
I know Turkish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does <em>not</em> use the accusative. Why? I’m not sure if there’s a sensible
explanation. To me, it makes more sense that Turkish is definite here; it refers
to a specific language, Turkish. But this is simply the way it is: there is no
accusative.</p>

<p>In another example put forth in the Turkish Discord, the opposite is true with
the verb <em>sevmek</em>. The accusative would be
used here this time to refer to the Turkish language specifically. It would be
incorrect to drop the accusative here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Accusative with sevmek</strong></p>

  <p>Türkçeyi seviyorum.
I love the Turkish language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can also be used without the accusative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>An explanation in the Discord</strong></p>

  <p>“Türkçe seviyorum” could be used in a context where you like doing something IN Turkish. Like “in which language do you like watching series?” You could say “Türkçe seviyorum.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is by no means meant to completely cover the cases of using or not using
the accusative, but hopefully it clarifies specific situations where the
“definite direct object” definition is insufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, even if you don’t get these correct in speech or writing, don’t sweat
it: what you want to express will probably be understood. Language is
approximate.  People definitely aren’t writing in perfect grammar on the
internet – go check out some Turkish YouTube comments.</p>
